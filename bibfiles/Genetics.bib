abstract = {Genetic discovery from the multitude of phenotypes extractable from routine healthcare data can transform understanding of the human phenome and accelerate progress toward precision medicine. However, a critical question when analyzing high-dimensional and heterogeneous data is how best to interrogate increasingly specific subphenotypes while retaining statistical power to detect genetic associations. Here we develop and employ a new Bayesian analysis framework that exploits the hierarchical structure of diagnosis classifications to analyze genetic variants against UK Biobank disease phenotypes derived from self-reporting and hospital episode statistics. Our method displays a more than 20{\%} increase in power to detect genetic effects over other approaches and identifies new associations between classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and common immune-mediated diseases (IMDs). By applying the approach to genetic risk scores (GRSs), we show the extent of genetic sharing among IMDs and expose differences in disease perception or diagnosis with potential clinical implications. Large-scale, hypothesis-free approaches for identifying genetic risk variants, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing analyses, have greatly advanced under-standing of complex traits, with implications for drug development and clinical practice 1–5 . These approaches typically involve genetic discovery from case–control cohorts where clinically derived pheno-types are considered one at a time. By contrast, resources such as the UK Biobank 6,7 , which has prospectively collected extensive health-relevant phenotypic and genotypic information from 500,000 partici-pants, allow for simultaneous investigation of multiple traits and are set to lead to a step change in the rate of genetic discovery 8,9 . However, capitalizing on the availability of population-based cohorts for biomedical research is complicated by the scale and nature of the data: the phenotypic space is multidimensional and heterogeneous, as data can be subject to observational predilec-tions, non-uniform recording practices and longitudinal biases while phenotype prevalence is variable 10–16 . This creates new challenges that are not addressed by existing analytical methods for GWAS and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). An open question is how to interrogate the many precise phenotypes obtainable from routine healthcare data at a resolution that identifies associa-tions above and beyond those identified through GWAS, but without sacrificing statistical power. Making use of disease classification hier-archies, such as the tree of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes, provides a tractable solution. Here we have developed a new Bayesian analysis framework for identifying genetic associations across the entire health phenotype space by taking advantage of the relative topology of nodes within two tree-structured phenotypic data sets from the UK Biobank—the self-reported (SR) diagnoses that are organized using the UK Biobank classification tree, which includes 531 diagnostic terms, and the hospitalization episode statistics (HES) data that utilize ICD-10 codes and contain 16,310 diagnostic terms.},

abstract = {It is widely recognized that the accuracy of colocalization measurements is dependent upon the quality of the source images. We demonstrate that, as the image quality increases, the measured colocalization, using the Pearson and Spearman rank correlation coefficients, approaches the true colocalization asymptotically. This means that in practice it is difficult to obtain images of sufficient quality for accurate measurements. We introduce the replicate-based noise corrected correlation (RBNCC) which aligns the measured colocalization with the true colocalization: a noise measurement is made for each fluorophore from a pair of replicate images, the two noise measurements are combined to generate a correction factor which is applied to the measured colocalization between the two fluorophores. In consequence, accurate measurements can be obtained even with noisy images, making RBNCC especially attractive for live imaging. Even with images of apparently good quality we found an average discrepancy of about 20{\%} between the measured and corrected colocalization. A case is made for using the Spearman rank coefficient instead of the Pearson coefficient to measure colocalization.},

@article{Chen1999b,
abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is generally used to obtain information about the number of fluorescent particles in a small volume and the diffusion coefficient from the autocorrelation function of the fluorescence signal. Here we demonstrate that photon counting histogram (PCH) analysis constitutes a novel tool for extracting quantities from fluorescence fluctuation data, i.e., the measured photon counts per molecule and the average number of molecules within the observation volume. The photon counting histogram of fluorescence fluctuation experiments, in which few molecules are present in the excitation volume, exhibits a super-Poissonian behavior. The additional broadening of the PCH compared to a Poisson distribution is due to fluorescence intensity fluctuations. For diffusing particles these intensity fluctuations are caused by an inhomogeneous excitation profile and the fluctuations in the number of particles in the observation volume. The quantitative relationship between the detected photon counts and the fluorescence intensity reaching the detector is given by Mandel's formula. Based on this equation and considering the fluorescence intensity distribution in the two-photon excitation volume, a theoretical expression for the PCH as a function of the number of molecules in the excitation volume is derived. For a single molecular species two parameters are sufficient to characterize the histogram completely, namely the average number of molecules within the observation volume and the detected photon counts per molecule per sampling time epsilon. The PCH for multiple molecular species, on the other hand, is generated by successively convoluting the photon counting distribution of each species with the others. The influence of the excitation profile upon the photon counting statistics for two relevant point spread functions (PSFs), the three-dimensional Gaussian PSF conventionally employed in confocal detection and the square of the Gaussian-Lorentzian PSF for two photon excitation, is explicitly treated. Measured photon counting distributions obtained with a two-photon excitation source agree, within experimental error with the theoretical PCHs calculated for the square of a Gaussian-Lorentzian beam profile. We demonstrate and discuss the influence of the average number of particles within the observation volume and the detected photon counts per molecule per sampling interval upon the super-Poissonian character of the photon counting distribution.},

@article{Adler2010e,
abstract = {The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and the Mander's overlap coefficient (MOC) are used to quantify the degree of colocalization between fluorophores. The MOC was introduced to overcome perceived problems with the PCC. The two coefficients are mathematically similar, differing in the use of either the absolute intensities (MOC) or of the deviation from the mean (PCC). A range of correlated datasets, which extend to the limits of the PCC, only evoked a limited response from the MOC. The PCC is unaffected by changes to the offset while the MOC increases when the offset is positive. Both coefficients are independent of gain. The MOC is a confusing hybrid measurement, that combines correlation with a heavily weighted form of co-occurrence, favors high intensity combinations, downplays combinations in which either or both intensities are low and ignores blank pixels. The PCC only measures correlation. A surprising finding was that the addition of a second uncorrelated population can substantially increase the measured correlation, demonstrating the importance of excluding background pixels. Overall, since the MOC is unresponsive to substantial changes in the data and is hard to interpret, it is neither an alternative to nor a useful substitute for the PCC. The MOC is not suitable for making measurements of colocalization either by correlation or co-occurrence.},
