In this study, we investigate the extent to which this task-related dichotomy is represented intrinsically in the resting human brain through examination of spontaneous fluctuations in the functional MRI blood oxygen level-dependent signal. We identify two diametrically opposed, widely distributed brain networks on the basis of both spontaneous correlations within each network and anticorrelations between networks. One network consists of regions routinely exhibiting task-related activations and the other of regions routinely exhibiting task-related deactivations. This intrinsic organization, featuring the presence of anticorrelated networks in the absence of overt task performance, provides a critical context in which to understand brain function. We suggest that both task-driven neuronal responses and behavior are reflections of this dynamic, ongoing, functional organization of the brain.},

Recently, however, paradigms have been studied in which the converse operation is performed, thus inferring behavioral or mental states associated with activation images. Here, we use the well-known retinotopy of the visual cortex to infer the visual content of real or imaginary scenes from the brain activation patterns that they elicit. We present two decoding algorithms: an explicit technique, based on the current knowledge of the retinotopic structure of the visual areas, and an implicit technique, based on supervised classifiers. Both algorithms predicted the stimulus identity with significant accuracy. Furthermore, we extend this principle to mental imagery data: in five data sets, our algorithms could reconstruct and predict with significant accuracy a pattern imagined by the subjects. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Images from positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are often modelled as stationary Gaussian random fields, and a general linear model is used to test for the effect of explanatory varaibles on a set of such images (Friston et al., 1994; Worsley and Friston, 1995). Thompson et al. (1996) have modelled displacements of brain surfaces as a multivariate Gaussian random field. In order to test for significant local maxima in such fields using the theory of Adler (1981) and its recent refinements (Worsley, 1994, 1995a, 1995b; Siegmund andWorsley, 1995), we need to estimate the roughness of such fields. This is defined as the variance matrix of the derivative of the random field in each dimension. Some methods have been given by Worlsey et al. (1992) for the special case of stationary variance of the random field, and where the random field is sampled on a uniform lattice. In this note we generalise to the case of multivariate Gaussian data with unknown non-stationary variance matrix, and non-lattice sampling. This latter is particularly important for studying the displacement of brain surfaces, which will be the subject of a future publication.},

@article{Geuter2018,
abstract = {Multi-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis is often concerned with determining whether there exists a significant population-wide 'activation' in a comparison between two or more conditions. Typically this is assessed by testing the average value of a contrast of parameter estimates (COPE) against zero in a general linear model (GLM) analysis. In this work we investigate several aspects of this type of analysis. First, we study the effects of sample size on the sensitivity and reliability of the group analysis, allowing us to evaluate the ability of small sampled studies to effectively capture population-level effects of interest. Second, we assess the difference in sensitivity and reliability when using volumetric or surface based data. Third, we investigate potential biases in estimating effect sizes as a function of sample size. To perform this analysis we utilize the task-based fMRI data from the 500-subject release from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We treat the complete collection of subjects (N = 491) as our population of interest, and perform a single-subject analysis on each subject in the population. We investigate the ability to recover population level effects using a subset of the population and standard analytical techniques. Our study shows that sample sizes of 40 are generally able to detect regions with high effect sizes (Cohen's d {\textgreater} 0.8), while sample sizes closer to 80 are required to reliably recover regions with medium effect sizes (0.5 {\textless} d {\textless} 0.8). We find little difference in results when using volumetric or surface based data with respect to standard mass-univariate group analysis. Finally, we conclude that special care is needed when estimating effect sizes, particularly for small sample sizes.},

@article{SmithM2003,
abstract = {Statistical parametric mapping (SPM), relying on the general linear model and classical hypothesis testing, is a benchmark tool for assessing human brain activity using data from fMRI experiments. Friston et al. (Neuroimage 16 (2002a), 484) discuss some limitations of this frequentist approach and point out promising Bayesian perspectives. In particular, a Bayesian formulation allows explicit modeling and estimation of activation probabilities. In this study, we directly address this issue and develop a new regression based approach using spatial Bayesian variable selection. Our method has several advantages. First, spatial correlation is directly modeled for activation probabilities and indirectly for activation amplitudes. As a consequence, there is no need for spatial adjustment in a postprocessing step. Second, anatomical prior information, such as the distribution of grey matter or expert knowledge, can be included as part of the model. Third, the method has superior edge-preservation properties as well as being fast to compute. When applied to data from a simple visual experiment, the results demonstrate improved sensitivity for detecting activated cortical areas and for better preserving details of activated structures. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Large-scale functional or structural brain connectivity can be modeled as a network, or graph. This paper presents a statistical approach to identify connections in such a graph that may be associated with a diagnostic status in case-control studies, changing psychological contexts in task-based studies, or correlations with various cognitive and behavioral measures. The new approach, called the network-based statistic (NBS), is a method to control the family-wise error rate (in the weak sense) when mass-univariate testing is performed at every connection comprising the graph. To potentially offer a substantial gain in power, the NBS exploits the extent to which the connections comprising the contrast or effect of interest are interconnected. The NBS is based on the principles underpinning traditional cluster-based thresholding of statistical parametric maps. The purpose of this paper is to: (i) introduce the NBS for the first time; (ii) evaluate its power with the use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves; and, (iii) demonstrate its utility with application to a real case-control study involving a group of people with schizophrenia for which resting-state functional MRI data were acquired. The NBS identified a expansive dysconnected subnetwork in the group with schizophrenia, primarily comprising fronto-temporal and occipito-temporal dysconnections, whereas a mass-univariate analysis controlled with the false discovery rate failed to identify a subnetwork. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Finding objective and effective thresholds for voxelwise statistics derived from neuroimaging data has been a long-standing problem. With at least one test performed for every voxel in an image, some correction of the thresholds is needed to control the error rates, but standard procedures for multiple hypothesis testing (e.g., Bonferroni) tend to not be sensitive enough to be useful in this context. This paper introduces to the neuroscience literature statistical procedures for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Recent theoretical work in statistics suggests that FDR-controlling procedures will be effective for the analysis of neuroimaging data. These procedures operate simultaneously on all voxelwise test statistics to determine which tests should be considered statistically significant. The innovation of the procedures is that they control the expected proportion of the rejected hypotheses that are falsely rejected. We demonstrate this approach using both simulations and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from two simple experiments. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

abstract = {Despite the growing importance of longitudinal data in neuroimaging, the standard analysis methods make restrictive or unrealistic assumptions (e.g., assumption of Compound Symmetry-the state of all equal variances and equal correlations-or spatially homogeneous longitudinal correlations). While some new methods have been proposed to more accurately account for such data, these methods are based on iterative algorithms that are slow and failure-prone. In this article, we propose the use of the Sandwich Estimator method which first estimates the parameters of interest with a simple Ordinary Least Square model and second estimates variances/covariances with the "so-called" Sandwich Estimator (SwE) which accounts for the within-subject correlation existing in longitudinal data. Here, we introduce the SwE method in its classic form, and we review and propose several adjustments to improve its behaviour, specifically in small samples. We use intensive Monte Carlo simulations to compare all considered adjustments and isolate the best combination for neuroimaging data.

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a noninvasive neuroimaging method that provides an indirect measure of neuronal activity by detecting blood flow changes, has experienced an explosive growth in the past years. Statistical methods play a crucial role in understanding and analyzing fMRI data. Bayesian approaches, in particular, have shown great promise in applications. A remarkable feature of fully Bayesian approaches is that they allow a flexible modeling of spatial and temporal correlations in the data. This article provides a review of the most relevant models developed in recent years. We divide methods according to the objective of the analysis. We start from spatiotemporal models for fMRI data that detect task-related activation patterns. We then address the very important problem of estimating brain connectivity. We also touch upon methods that focus on making predictions of an individual's brain activity or a clinical or behavioral response. We conclude with a discussion of recent integrative models that aim at combining fMRI data with other imaging modalities, such as electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, measured on the same subjects. We also briefly discuss the emerging field of imaging genetics.},

abstract = {We present a fully Bayesian approach to modeling in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), incorporating spatio-temporal noise modeling and haemodynamic response function (HRF) modeling. A fully Bayesian approach allows for the uncertainties in the noise and signal modeling to be incorporated together to provide full posterior distributions of the HRF parameters. The noise modeling is achieved via a nonseparable space-time vector autoregressive process. Previous FMRI noise models have either been purely temporal, separable or modeling deterministic trends. The specific form of the noise process is determined using model selection techniques. Notably, this results in the need for a spatially nonstationary and temporally stationary spatial component. Within the same full model, we also investigate the variation of the HRF in different areas of the activation, and for different experimental stimuli. We propose a novel HRF model made up of half-cosines, which allows distinct combinations of parameters to represent characteristics of interest. In addition, to adaptively avoid over-fitting we propose the use of automatic relevance determination priors to force certain parameters in the model to zero with high precision if there is no evidence to support them in the data. We apply the model to three datasets and observe matter-type dependence of the spatial and temporal noise, and a negative correlation between activation height and HRF time to main peak (although we suggest that this apparent correlation may be due to a number of different effects).},

abstract = {Beginning in infancy, people can be characterized in terms of two dimensions of attachment insecurity: attachment anxiety (i.e., fear of rejection and abandonment) and attachment avoidance (distancing oneself from close others, shunning dependency; Bowlby, J., 1969/1982. Attachment and loss: Vol. 1. Attachment, 2nd ed., Basic Books, New York). The capacity for emotion regulation varies with attachment style, such that attachment-anxious individuals become highly emotional when threatened with social rejection or relationship loss, whereas avoidant individuals tend to distance themselves or disengage from emotional situations. In the present study, 20 women participated in an fMRI experiment in which they thought about-and were asked to stop thinking about-various relationship scenarios. When they thought about negative ones (conflict, breakup, death of partner), their level of attachment anxiety was positively correlated with activation in emotion-related areas of the brain (e.g., the anterior temporal pole, implicated in sadness) and inversely correlated with activation in a region associated with emotion regulation (orbitofrontal cortex). This suggests that anxious people react more strongly than non-anxious people to thoughts of loss while under-recruiting brain regions normally used to down-regulate negative emotions. Participants high on avoidance failed to show as much deactivation as less avoidant participants in two brain regions (subcallosal cingulate cortex; lateral prefrontal cortex). This suggests that the avoidant peoples' suppression was less complete or less efficient, in line with results from previous behavioral experiments. These are among the first findings to identify some of the neural processes underlying adult attachment orientations and emotion regulation. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an approach to the identification of nonlinear input-state-output systems. By using a bilinear approximation to the dynamics of interactions among states, the parameters of the implicit causal model reduce to three sets. These comprise (1) parameters that mediate the influence of extrinsic inputs on the states, (2) parameters that mediate intrinsic coupling among the states, and (3) [bilinear] parameters that allow the inputs to modulate that coupling. Identification proceeds in a Bayesian framework given known, deterministic inputs and the observed responses of the system. We developed this approach for the analysis of effective connectivity using experimentally designed inputs and fMRI responses. In this context, the coupling parameters correspond to effective connectivity and the bilinear parameters reflect the changes in connectivity induced by inputs. The ensuing framework allows one to characterise fMRI experiments, conceptually, as an experimental manipulation of integration among brain regions (by contextual or trial-free inputs, like time or attentional set) that is revealed using evoked responses (to perturbations or trial-bound inputs, like stimuli). As with previous analyses of effective connectivity, the focus is on experimentally induced changes in coupling (cf., psychophysiologic interactions). However, unlike previous approaches in neuroimaging, the causal model ascribes responses to designed deterministic inputs, as opposed to treating inputs as unknown and stochastic. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {Statistically underpowered studies can result in experimental failure even when all other experimental considerations have been addressed impeccably. In fMRI the combination of a large number of dependent variables, a relatively small number of observations (subjects), and a need to correct for multiple comparisons can decrease statistical power dramatically. This problem has been clearly addressed yet remains controversial—especially in regards to the expected effect sizes in fMRI, and especially for between-subjects effects such as group comparisons and brain-behavior correlations. We aimed to clarify the power problem by considering and contrasting two simulated scenarios of such possible brain-behavior correlations: weak diffuse effects and strong localized effects. Sampling from these scenarios shows that, particularly in the weak diffuse scenario, common sample sizes (n = 20–30) display extremely low statistical power, poorly represent the actual effects in the full sample, and show large variation on subsequent replications. Empirical data from the Human Connectome Project resembles the weak diffuse scenario much more than the localized strong scenario, which underscores the extent of the power problem for many studies. Possible solutions to the power problem include increasing the sample size, using less stringent thresholds, or focusing on a region-of-interest. However, these approaches are not always feasible and some have major drawbacks. The most prominent solutions that may help address the power problem include model-based (multivariate) prediction methods and meta-analyses with related synthesis-oriented approaches.},

Accurate p values for local maxima are readily available for isotropic data based on the expected Euler characteristic of the excursion set of the test statistic random field. In this article we give a simple method for dealing with nonisotropic data. Our approach has connections to the model of Sampson and Guttorp for nonisotropy in which there exists an unknown mapping of the support of the data to a space in which the random fields are isotropic. Heuristic justification for our approach comes from the Nash embedding theorem. Formally, we show that our method gives consistent unbiased estimators for the true p values based on new results of Taylor and Adler for random fields on manifolds, which replace the Euclidean metric by the variogram. The results are used to detect gender differences in the cortical thickness of the brain and to detect regions of the brain involved in sentence comprehension measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging.},

abstract = {The assessment of significant activations in functional imaging using voxel-based methods often relies on results derived from the theory of Gaussian random fields. These results solve the multiple comparison problem and assume that the spatial correlation or smoothness of the data is known or can be estimated. End results (i. e., P values associated with local maxima, clusters, or sets of clusters) critically depend on this assessment, which should be as exact and as reliable as possible. In some earlier implementations of statistical parametric mapping (SPM) (SPM94, SPM95) the smoothness was assessed on Gaussianized t-fields (Gt-f) that are not generally free of physiological signal. This technique has two limitations. First, the estimation is not stable (the variance of the estimator being far from negligible) and, second, physiological signal in the Gt-f will bias the estimation. In this paper, we describe an estimation method that overcomes these drawbacks. The new approach involves estimating the smoothness of standardized residual fields which approximates the smoothness of the component fields of the associated t-field. Knowing the smoothness of these component fields is important because it allows one to compute corrected P values for statistical fields other than the t-field or the Gt-f (e.g., the F-map) and eschews bias due to deviation from the null hypothesis. We validate the method on simulated data and demonstrate it using data from a functional MRI study.},

abstract = {We describe a new, observer-independent procedure for identifying boundaries between cortical areas. The method is useful for images obtained from sections which provide microstructural information on the cortical laminar pattern, e.g., Nissl-, myelin-, or immunohistochemically stained sections or receptor autoradiographs. The laminar pattern is represented by profile curves extending from the cortical surface to the white matter boundary. These profiles are constructed from digitized images. Digitization is based on the grey level index (Nissl) or densitometry (myelin, immunohistochemistry, receptor autoradiography). The shapes of neighboring profiles are compared by calculating their distances according to feature vectors extracted from the profiles. Profiles derived from a homogeneous area can be expected to be similar in shape and hence show low distance values between each other. Maximum distances can be found between profiles which lie on opposite sides of a structural boundary. The Mahalanobis distance was found to be more sensitive and to yield greater spatial resolution than other distance measures such as the Euclidean distance. Cell-stained sections of the human neocortex were analyzed. The method not only verified boundaries which had been defined by visual inspection, it also revealed new ones which had not been detected visually. The procedure offers an important supplement to the traditional methods based on visual inspection which, for the first time, is based on quantitative data and therefore offers a new level of reproducibility and observer independence. Anatomical atlases based on this procedure thus provide a new tool for the interpretation of structural data obtained from functional imaging techniques.},

abstract = {Representational models specify how complex patterns of neural activity relate to visual stimuli, motor actions, or abstract thoughts. Here we review pattern component modeling (PCM), a practical Bayesian approach for evaluating such models. Similar to encoding models, PCM evaluates the ability of models to predict novel brain activity patterns. In contrast to encoding models, however, the activity of individual voxels across conditions (activity profiles) are not directly fitted. Rather, PCM integrates over all possible activity profiles and computes the marginal likelihood of the data under the activity profile distribution specified by the representational model. By using an analytical expression for the marginal likelihood, PCM allows the fitting of flexible representational models, in which the relative strength and form of the encoded features can be estimated from the data. We discuss here a number of different forms with which such flexible representational models can be specified, and how models of different complexity can be compared. We then provide a number of practical examples from our recent work in motor control, ranging from fixed models to more complex non-linear models of brain representations. The code for the fitting and cross-validation of representational models is provided in a open-source Matlab toolbox.},

abstract = {To provide an effective substrate for cognitive processes, functional brain networks should be able to reorganize and coordinate on a sub-second temporal scale. We used magnetoencephalography recordings of spontaneous activity to characterize whole-brain functional connectivity dynamics at high temporal resolution. Using a novel approach that identifies the points in time at which unique patterns of activity recur, we reveal transient (100-200 ms) brain states with spatial topographies similar to those of well-known resting state networks. By assessing temporal changes in the occurrence of these states, we demonstrate that within-network functional connectivity is underpinned by coordinated neuronal dynamics that fluctuate much more rapidly than has previously been shown. We further evaluate cross-network interactions, and show that anticorrelation between the default mode network and parietal regions of the dorsal attention network is consistent with an inability of the system to transition directly between two transient brain states.

abstract = {A technique is described for estimating the position of the intercommisural line (AC-PC line) directly from landmarks on positron emission tomographic (PET) images, namely the ventral aspects of the anterior and posterior corpus callosum, the thalamus, and occipital pole. The relationship of this estimate to the true AC-PC line, fitted through the centres of the anterior and posterior commissures, showed minimal vertical and angular displacement when measured on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Using regression analysis, the ease and reliability of fitting to these points was found to be high. This directly derived AC-PC line estimate was validated in terms of the assumptions used in the method of Fox et al. The ratio of distance between the AC-PC line and a line passing through the base of the inion (GI line) to total brain height was 0.21, as predicted. The technique has been further validated by localizing focal activation of the sensorimotor cortex. The technique is discussed in terms of absolute limits to localization of structures in the brain using noninvasive tomographic techniques in general and PET in particular.},

abstract = {This paper presents a general approach to the analysis of functional MRI time-series from one or more subjects. The approach is predicated on an extension of the general linear model that allows for correlations between error terms due to physiological noise or correlations that ensue after temporal smoothing. This extension uses the effective degrees of freedom associated with the error term. The effective degrees of freedom are a simple function of the number of scans and the temporal auto correlation function. A specific form for the latter can be assumed if the data are smoothed, in time, to accentuate hemodynamic responses with a neural basis. This assumption leads to an expedient implementation of a flexible statistical framework. The importance of this small extension is that, in contradistinction to our previous approach, any parametric statistical analysis can be implemented. We demonstrate this point using a multiple regression analysis that tests for effects of interest (activations due to word generation), while taking explicit account of some obvious confounds.},

abstract = {Representational models explain how activity patterns in populations of neurons (or, more generally, in multivariate brain activity measurements) relate to sensory stimuli, motor actions, or cognitive processes. In an experimental context, representational models can be defined as probabilistic hypotheses about what activation profiles across experimental conditions are likely to be observed. We describe three methods to test such models - encoding approaches, pattern component modeling (PCM), and representational similarity analysis (RSA). We show that these methods are closely related in that they evaluate the statistical second moment of the activity profile distribution. Using simulated data from three different fMRI experiments, we compare the power of the approaches to adjudicate between competing representational models. PCM implements a likelihood-ratio test and therefore constitutes the most powerful test if its assumptions hold. However, the other two approaches - when conducted appropriately - can perform similarly. In encoding approaches, the linear model needs to be appropriately regularized, which imposes a prior on the activity profiles. Without such a prior, encoding approaches do not test well-defined representational models. In RSA, the unequal variances and dependencies of the distance measures need to be taken into account to enable near-optimal inference. The three techniques render different aspects of the information explicit (e.g. single response tuning in encoding approaches and population representational dissimilarity in RSA) and have specific advantages in terms of computational demands, ease of use, and extensibility. We argue that they constitute complementary parts of the same computational toolkit aimed at understanding neural representations on the basis of multivariate brain-activity data.},

Such extensive testing increases the number of false positives and correction for multiple comparisons is needed. Method: Here we review all cluster-based correction for multiple comparison methods (cluster-height, cluster-size, cluster-mass, and threshold free cluster enhancement - TFCE), in conjunction with two computational approaches (permutation and bootstrap). Results: Data driven Monte-Carlo simulations comparing two conditions within subjects (two sample Student's t-test) showed that, on average, all cluster-based methods using permutation or bootstrap alike control well the family-wise error rate (FWER), with a few caveats. Conclusions: (i) A minimum of 800 iterations are necessary to obtain stable results; (ii) below 50 trials, bootstrap methods are too conservative; (iii) for low critical family-wise error rates (e.g. p=. 1{\%}), permutations can be too liberal; (iv) TFCE controls best the type 1 error rate with an attenuated extent parameter (i.e. power. {\textless}. 1).},

This method was applied to two example datasets: comparison of words versus nonwords in a lexical decision task and initial versus repeated presentations of faces in a fame-judgment task. Tests across subjects revealed both magnitude and latency differences within several brain regions. This approach offers a computationally efficient means of detecting BOLD latency differences over the whole brain.

abstract = {Here we introduce a multivariate framework for characterising longitudinal changes in structural MRI using dynamical systems. The general approach enables modelling changes of states in multiple imaging biomarkers typically observed during brain development, plasticity, ageing and degeneration, e.g. regional gray matter volume of multiple regions of interest (ROIs). Structural brain states follow intrinsic dynamics according to a linear system with additional inputs accounting for potential driving forces of brain development. In particular, the inputs to the system are specified to account for known or latent developmental growth/decline factors, e.g. due to effects of growth hormones, puberty, or sudden behavioural changes etc. Because effects of developmental factors might be region-specific, the sensitivity of each ROI to contributions of each factor is explicitly modelled. In addition to the external effects of developmental factors on regional change, the framework enables modelling and inference about directed (potentially reciprocal) interactions between brain regions, due to competition for space, or structural connectivity, and suchlike. This approach accounts for repeated measures in typical MRI studies of development and aging. Model inversion and posterior distributions are obtained using earlier established variational methods enabling Bayesian evidence-based comparisons between various models of structural change. Using this approach we demonstrate dynamic cortical changes during brain maturation between 6 and 22 years of age using a large openly available longitudinal paediatric dataset with 637 scans from 289 individuals. In particular, we model volumetric changes in 26 bilateral ROIs, which cover large portions of cortical and subcortical gray matter. We account for (1) puberty-related effects on gray matter regions; (2) effects of an early transient growth process with additional time-lag parameter; (3) sexual dimorphism by modelling parameter differences between boys and girls. There is evidence that the regional pattern of sensitivity to dynamic hidden growth factors in late childhood is similar across genders and shows a consistent anterior-posterior gradient with strongest impact to prefrontal cortex (PFC) brain changes. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of the framework to explore the coupling of structural changes across a priori defined subnetworks using an example of previously established resting state functional connectivity.},

abstract = {In response to reports of inflated false positive rate (FPR) in FMRI group analysis tools, a series of replications, investigations, and software modifications were made to address this issue. While these investigations continue, significant progress has been made to adapt AFNI to fix such problems. Two separate lines of changes have been made. First, a long-tailed model for the spatial correlation of the FMRI noise characterized by autocorrelation function (ACF) was developed and implemented into the 3dClustSim tool for determining the cluster-size threshold to use for a given voxel-wise threshold. Second, the 3dttest++ program was modified to do randomization of the voxel-wise t-tests and then to feed those randomized t-statistic maps into 3dClustSim directly for cluster-size threshold determination﹣without any spatial model for the ACF. These approaches were tested with the Beijing subset of the FCON-1000 data collection. The first approach shows markedly improved (reduced) FPR, but in many cases is still above the nominal 5{\%}. The second approach shows FPRs clustered tightly about 5{\%} across all per-voxel p-value thresholds ≤ 0.01. If t-tests from a univariate GLM are adequate for the group analysis in question, the second approach is what the AFNI group currently recommends for thresholding. If more complex per-voxel statistical analyses are required (where permutation/randomization is impracticable), then our current recommendation is to use the new ACF modeling approach coupled with a per-voxel p-threshold of 0.001 or below. Simulations were also repeated with the now infamously "buggy" version of 3dClustSim: the effect of the bug on FPRs was minimal (of order a few percent).},

abstract = {Many sources of fluctuation contribute to the fMRI signal, and this makes identifying the effects that are truly related to the underlying neuronal activity difficult. Independent component analysis (ICA) - one of the most widely used techniques for the exploratory analysis of fMRI data - has shown to be a powerful technique in identifying various sources of neuronally-related and artefactual fluctuation in fMRI data (both with the application of external stimuli and with the subject "at rest"). ICA decomposes fMRI data into patterns of activity (a set of spatial maps and their corresponding time series) that are statistically independent and add linearly to explain voxel-wise time series. Given the set of ICA components, if the components representing "signal" (brain activity) can be distinguished form the "noise" components (effects of motion, non-neuronal physiology, scanner artefacts and other nuisance sources), the latter can then be removed from the data, providing an effective cleanup of structured noise. Manual classification of components is labour intensive and requires expertise; hence, a fully automatic noise detection algorithm that can reliably detect various types of noise sources (in both task and resting fMRI) is desirable. In this paper, we introduce FIX ("FMRIB's ICA-based X-noiseifier"), which provides an automatic solution for denoising fMRI data via accurate classification of ICA components. For each ICA component FIX generates a large number of distinct spatial and temporal features, each describing a different aspect of the data (e.g., what proportion of temporal fluctuations are at high frequencies). The set of features is then fed into a multi-level classifier (built around several different classifiers). Once trained through the hand-classification of a sufficient number of training datasets, the classifier can then automatically classify new datasets. The noise components can then be subtracted from (or regressed out of) the original data, to provide automated cleanup. On conventional resting-state fMRI (rfMRI) single-run datasets, FIX achieved about 95{\%} overall accuracy. On high-quality rfMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, FIX achieves over 99{\%} classification accuracy, and as a result is being used in the default rfMRI processing pipeline for generating HCP connectomes. FIX is publicly available as a plugin for FSL. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

@article{Bielczyk2018,
abstract = {Functional connectivity has been shown to be a very promising tool for studying the large-scale functional architecture of the human brain. In network research in fMRI, functional connectivity is considered as a set of pair-wise interactions between the nodes of the network. These interactions are typically operationalized through the full or partial correlation between all pairs of regional time series. Estimating the structure of the latent underlying functional connectome from the set of pair-wise partial correlations remains an open research problem though. Typically, this thresholding problem is approached by proportional thresholding, or by means of parametric or non-parametric permutation testing across a cohort of subjects at each possible connection. As an alternative, we propose a data-driven thresholding approach for network matrices on the basis of mixture modeling. This approach allows for creating subject-specific sparse connectomes by modeling the full set of partial correlations as a mixture of low correlation values associated with weak or unreliable edges in the connectome and a sparse set of reliable connections. Consequently, we propose to use alternative thresholding strategy based on the model fit using pseudo-False Discovery Rates derived on the basis of the empirical null estimated as part of the mixture distribution. We evaluate the method on synthetic benchmark fMRI datasets where the underlying network structure is known, and demonstrate that it gives improved performance with respect to the alternative methods for thresholding connectomes, given the canonical thresholding levels. We also demonstrate that mixture modeling gives highly reproducible results when applied to the functional connectomes of the visual system derived from the n-back Working Memory task in the Human Connectome Project. The sparse connectomes obtained from mixture modeling are further discussed in the light of the previous knowledge of the functional architecture of the visual system in humans. We also demonstrate that with use of our method, we are able to extract similar information on the group level as can be achieved with permutation testing even though these two methods are not equivalent. We demonstrate that with both of these methods, we obtain functional decoupling between the two hemispheres in the higher order areas of the visual cortex during visual stimulation as compared to the resting state, which is in line with previous studies suggesting lateralization in the visual processing. However, as opposed to permutation testing, our approach does not require inference at the cohort level and can be used for creating sparse connectomes at the level of a single subject.},

abstract = {In nonstationary images, cluster inference depends on the local image smoothness, as clusters tend to be larger in smoother regions by chance alone. In order to correct the inference for such nonstationary, cluster sizes can be adjusted according to a local smoothness estimate. In this study, adjusted cluster sizes are used in a permutation-testing framework for both cluster-based and threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) inference and tested on both simulated and real data. We find that TFCE inference is already fairly robust to nonstationarity in the data, while cluster-based inference requires an adjustment to ensure homogeneity. A group of possible multi-level adjustments are introduced and their results on simulated and real data are assessed using a new performance index. We also find that adjusting for local smoothness via a separate resampling procedure is more effective at removing nonstationarity than an adjustment via a random field theory based smoothness estimator. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Zarahn1997,
abstract = {In the companion to this paper (E. Zarahn, G. K. Aguirre, and M. D'Esposito, 1997,NeuroImage,179-197), we describe an implementation of a general linear model for autocorrelated observations in which the voxel-wise false-positive rates in fMRI "noise" datasets were stabilized and brought close to theoretical values. Here, implementations of the model are tested for use with statistical parametric mapping analysis of spatially smoothed fMRI data. Analyses using varying models of intrinsic temporal autocorrelation and either including or excluding a global signal covariate were conducted upon human subject data collected under null hypothesis as well as under experimental conditions. We found that smoothing with an empirically derived impulse response function (IRF), combined with a model of the intrinsic temporal autocorrelation in spatially smoothed fMRI data, resulted in a map-wise false-positive rate which did not exceed a 5{\%} level when a nominal [alpha] = 0.05 tabular threshold was applied. Use of other models of intrinsic temporal autocorrelation resulted in map-wise false-positive rates that significantly exceeded this level. fMRI data collected while subjects performed a behavioral task were used to examine (a) task-dependent global signal changes and (b) the dependence of sensitivity on the temporal smoothing kernel and inclusion/exclusion of a global signal covariate. The global signal changes within an fMRI dataset were shown to be influenced by the performance of a behavioral task. However, the inclusion of this measure as a covariate did not have an adverse affect upon our measure of sensitivity. Finally, use of an empirically derived estimate of the IRF of the system was shown to result in greater map-wise sensitivity for signal changes than the use of a broader (in time) Poisson (parameter = 8 s) kernel.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been growing interest in multivariate analyses of neuroimaging data, which can be used to detect distributed patterns of activity that encode an experimental factor of interest. In this setting, it has become common practice to study the correlations between patterns to make inferences about the way a brain region represents stimuli or tasks (known as representational similarity analysis). Although it would be of great interest to compare these correlations from different regions, direct comparisons are currently not possible. This is because sample correlations are strongly influenced by voxel-selection, fMRI noise, and nonspecific activation patterns, all of which can differ widely between regions. Here, we present a multivariate modeling framework in which the measured patterns are decomposed into their constituent parts. The model is based on a standard linear mixed model, in which pattern components are considered to be randomly distributed over voxels. The model allows one to estimate the true correlations of the underlying neuronal pattern components, thereby enabling comparisons between different regions or individuals. The pattern estimates also allow us to make inferences about the spatial structure of different response components. Thus, the new model provides a theoretical and analytical framework to study the structure of distributed neural representations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In functional magnetic resonance imaging statistical analysis there are problems with accounting for temporal autocorrelations when assessing change within voxels. Techniques to date have utilized temporal filtering strategies to either shape these autocorrelations or remove them. Shaping, or "coloring," attempts to negate the effects of not accurately knowing the intrinsic autocorrelations by imposing known autocorrelation via temporal filtering. Removing the autocorrelation, or "prewhitening," gives the best linear unbiased estimator, assuming that the autocorrelation is accurately known. For single-event designs, the efficiency of the estimator is considerably higher for prewhitening compared with coloring. However, it has been suggested that sufficiently accurate estimates of the autocorrelation are currently not available to give prewhitening acceptable bias. To overcome this, we consider different ways to estimate the autocorrelation for use in prewhitening. After high-pass filtering is performed, a Tukey taper (set to smooth the spectral density more than would normally be used in spectral density estimation) performs best. Importantly, estimation is further improved by using nonlinear spatial filtering to smooth the estimated autocorrelation, but only within tissue type. Using this approach when prewhitening reduced bias to close to zero at probability levels as low as 1 x 10(-5).},

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data are often analyzed using the general linear model employing a hypothesized neural model convolved with a hemodynamic response function. Mismatches between this hemodynamic model and the data can be induced by spatially varying delays or slice-timing differences. It is common practice to desensitize the analysis to such delays by incorporation of the hemodynamic model plus its temporal derivative. The rationale often used is that additional variance will be captured and regressed out from the data. Though this is true, it ignores the potential for amplitude bias induced by small model mismatches due to, for example, variable hemodynamic delays and is not helpful for "random effects" analyses which typically do not account for the first level variance at all. Amplitude bias is due to the use of only the nonderivative portion of the model in the final test for significant amplitudes. We propose instead testing an amplitude value that is a function of both the nonderivative and the derivative terms of the model. Using simulations, we show that the proposed amplitude test does not suffer from delay-induced bias and that a model incorporating temporal derivatives is a more natural test for amplitude differences. The proposed test is applied in a random-effects analysis of 100 subjects. It reveals increased amplitudes in areas consistent with the task, with the largest increases in regions with greater hemodynamic delays. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Many issues stemming from Nichols et al. are identified including: (1) Nichols et al. did not provide convincing arguments that resting-state fMRI data reflect null data. (2) Eklund et al. presented one-sample t-test results in the main body of their paper showing that their permutation method was acceptable, while their supplementary results showed that this method produced false-positive rates that were similar to other methods. (3) Eklund et al. used the same event protocol for all the participants, which artifactually inflated the one-sample t-test false-positive rates. (4) At p {\textless} .001, using two-sample t-tests (which corrected for the flawed analysis), all the methods employed to correct for multiple comparisons had acceptable false-positive rates. (5) Eklund et al. contrasted resting-state periods, which produced many significant clusters of activity, while null data should arguably be associated with few, if any, significant activations. Eklund et al.'s entire set of results show that commonly employed methods to correct for multiple comparisons have acceptable false-positive rates. Following Hopfinger along with Cunningham and Koscik, it is also highlighted that rather than focusing on only type I error, type I error and type II error should be balanced in fMRI analysis.},

abstract = {Permutation tests are increasingly being used as a reliable method for inference in neuroimaging analysis. However, they are computationally intensive. For small, non-imaging datasets, recomputing a model thousands of times is seldom a problem, but for large, complex models this can be prohibitively slow, even with the availability of inexpensive computing power. Here we exploit properties of statistics used with the general linear model (GLM) and their distributions to obtain accelerations irrespective of generic software or hardware improvements. We compare the following approaches: (i) performing a small number of permutations; (ii) estimating the p-value as a parameter of a negative binomial distribution; (iii) fitting a generalised Pareto distribution to the tail of the permutation distribution; (iv) computing p-values based on the expected moments of the permutation distribution, approximated from a gamma distribution; (v) direct fitting of a gamma distribution to the empirical permutation distribution; and (vi) permuting a reduced number of voxels, with completion of the remainder using low rank matrix theory. Using synthetic data we assessed the different methods in terms of their error rates, power, agreement with a reference result, and the risk of taking a different decision regarding the rejection of the null hypotheses (known as the resampling risk). We also conducted a re-analysis of a voxel-based morphometry study as a real-data example. All methods yielded exact error rates. Likewise, power was similar across methods. Resampling risk was higher for methods (i), (iii) and (v). For comparable resampling risks, the method in which no permutations are done (iv) was the absolute fastest. All methods produced visually similar maps for the real data, with stronger effects being detected in the family-wise error rate corrected maps by (iii) and (v), and generally similar to the results seen in the reference set. Overall, for uncorrected p-values, method (iv) was found the best as long as symmetric errors can be assumed. In all other settings, including for familywise error corrected p-values, we recommend the tail approximation (iii). The methods considered are freely available in the tool PALM — Permutation Analysis of Linear Models.},

abstract = {This article discusses general modeling of multisubject and/or multisession FMRI data. In particular, we show that a two-level mixed-effects model (where parameters of interest at the group level are estimated from parameter and variance estimates from the single-session level) can be made equivalent to a single complete mixed-effects model (where parameters of interest at the group level are estimated directly from all of the original single sessions' time series data) if the (co-)variance at the second level is set equal to the sum of the (co-)variances in the single-level form, using the BLUE with known covariances. This result has significant implications for group studies in FMRI, since it shows that the group analysis requires only values of the parameter estimates and their (co-)variance from the first level, generalizing the well-established "summary statistics" approach in FMRI. The simple and generalized framework allows different prewhitening and different first-level regressors to be used for each subject. The framework incorporates multiple levels and cases such as repeated measures, paired or unpaired t tests and F tests at the group level; explicit examples of such models are given in the article. Using numerical simulations based on typical first-level covariance structures from real FMRI data we demonstrate that by taking into account lower-level covariances and heterogeneity a substantial increase in higher-level Z score is possible. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {There is great interest in estimating brain "networks" from FMRI data. This is often attempted by identifying a set of functional "nodes" (e.g., spatial ROIs or ICA maps) and then conducting a connectivity analysis between the nodes, based on the FMRI timeseries associated with the nodes. Analysis methods range from very simple measures that consider just two nodes at a time (e.g., correlation between two nodes' timeseries) to sophisticated approaches that consider all nodes simultaneously and estimate one global network model (e.g., Bayes net models). Many different methods are being used in the literature, but almost none has been carefully validated or compared for use on FMRI timeseries data. In this work we generate rich, realistic simulated FMRI data for a wide range of underlying networks, experimental protocols and problematic confounds in the data, in order to compare different connectivity estimation approaches. Our results show that in general correlation-based approaches can be quite successful, methods based on higher-order statistics are less sensitive, and lag-based approaches perform very poorly. More specifically: there are several methods that can give high sensitivity to network connection detection on good quality FMRI data, in particular, partial correlation, regularised inverse covariance estimation and several Bayes net methods; however, accurate estimation of connection directionality is more difficult to achieve, though Patel's $\tau$can be reasonably successful. With respect to the various confounds added to the data, the most striking result was that the use of functionally inaccurate ROIs (when defining the network nodes and extracting their associated timeseries) is extremely damaging to network estimation; hence, results derived from inappropriate ROI definition (such as via structural atlases) should be regarded with great caution. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

However, it is not known to what extent brain regions are continuously interacting when the brain is "at rest." In this work, we identify the major explicit activation networks by carrying out an image-based activation network analysis of thousands of separate activation maps derived from the BrainMap database of functional imaging studies, involving nearly 30,000 human subjects. Independently, we extract the major covarying networks in the resting brain, as imaged with functional magnetic resonance imaging in 36 subjects at rest. The sets of major brain networks, and their decompositions into subnetworks, show close correspondence between the independent analyses of resting and activation brain dynamics. We conclude that the full repertoire of functional networks utilized by the brain in action is continuously and dynamically "active" even when at "rest."},

abstract = {Brain regions are often topographically connected: nearby locations within one brain area connect with nearby locations in another area. Mapping these connection topographies, or ‘connectopies' in short, is crucial for understanding how information is processed in the brain. Here, we propose principled, fully data-driven methods for mapping connectopies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired at rest by combining spectral embedding of voxel-wise connectivity ‘fingerprints' with a novel approach to spatial statistical inference. We apply the approach in human primary motor and visual cortex, and show that it can trace biologically plausible, overlapping connectopies in individual subjects that follow these regions' somatotopic and retinotopic maps. As a generic mechanism to perform inference over connectopies, the new spatial statistics approach enables rigorous statistical testing of hypotheses regarding the fine-grained spatial profile of functional connectivity and whether that profile is different between subjects or between experimental conditions. The combined framework offers a fundamental alternative to existing approaches to investigating functional connectivity in the brain, from voxel- or seed-pair wise characterizations of functional association, towards a full, multivariate characterization of spatial topography.},

abstract = {Many image enhancement and thresholding techniques make use of spatial neighbourhood information to boost belief in extended areas of signal. The most common such approach in neuroimaging is cluster-based thresholding, which is often more sensitive than voxel-wise thresholding. However, a limitation is the need to define the initial cluster-forming threshold. This threshold is arbitrary, and yet its exact choice can have a large impact on the results, particularly at the lower (e.g., t, z {\textless} 4) cluster-forming thresholds frequently used. Furthermore, the amount of spatial pre-smoothing is also arbitrary (given that the expected signal extent is very rarely known in advance of the analysis). In the light of such problems, we propose a new method which attempts to keep the sensitivity benefits of cluster-based thresholding (and indeed the general concept of "clusters" of signal), while avoiding (or at least minimising) these problems. The method takes a raw statistic image and produces an output image in which the voxel-wise values represent the amount of cluster-like local spatial support. The method is thus referred to as "threshold-free cluster enhancement" (TFCE). We present the TFCE approach and discuss in detail ROC-based optimisation and comparisons with cluster-based and voxel-based thresholding. We find that TFCE gives generally better sensitivity than other methods over a wide range of test signal shapes and SNR values. We also show an example on a real imaging dataset, suggesting that TFCE does indeed provide not just improved sensitivity, but richer and more interpretable output than cluster-based thresholding. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Estimates of functional connectivity using resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) are acutely sensitive to artifacts and large scale nuisance variation. As a result much effort is dedicated to preprocessing rs-fMRI data and using diagnostic measures to identify bad scans. One such diagnostic measure is DVARS, the spatial root mean square of the data after temporal differencing. A limitation of DVARS however is the lack of concrete interpretation of the absolute values of DVARS, and finding a threshold to distinguish bad scans from good. In this work we describe a sum of squares decomposition of the entire 4D dataset that shows DVARS to be just one of three sources of variation we refer to as D-var (closely linked to DVARS), S-var and E-var. D-var and S-var partition the sum of squares at adjacent time points, while E-var accounts for edge effects; each can be used to make spatial and temporal summary diagnostic measures. Extending the partitioning to global (and non-global) signal leads to a rs-fMRI DSE table, which decomposes the total and global variability into fast (D-var), slow (S-var) and edge (E-var) components. We find expected values for each component under nominal models, showing how D-var (and thus DVARS) scales with overall variability and is diminished by temporal autocorrelation. Finally we propose a null sampling distribution for DVARS-squared and robust methods to estimate this null model, allowing computation of DVARS p-values. We propose that these diagnostic time series, images, p-values and DSE table will provide a succinct summary of the quality of a rs-fMRI dataset that will support comparisons of datasets over preprocessing steps and between subjects.},

This article demonstrates a novel active tractor beam for multiple fully immersed objects with its additional abilities of yielding a controlled rotation and a desired 3D trapping. Continuous and stable long distance levitation, controlled rotation and 3D trapping are demonstrated with a single optical set-up by using two coaxial, or even non-coaxial, superimposed non-diffracting higher order Bessel beams of reverse helical nature and different frequencies. The superimposed beam has periodic intensity variations both along and around the beam-axis because of the difference in longitudinal wave-vectors and beam orders, respectively. The difference in frequencies of two laser beams makes the intensity pattern move along and around the beam-axis in a continuous way without manual ramping of phase, which allows for either linear motion (forward or backward) or angular movement (clockwise or anticlockwise) of fully immersed multiple particles. As a major contribution, the condition for increasing the target binding regions is also proposed to manipulate multiple immersed objects of different sizes and shapes.},

abstract = {Statistical parametric maps formed via voxel-wise mass-univariate tests, such as the general linear model, are commonly used to test hypotheses about regionally specific effects in neuroimaging cross-sectional studies where each subject is represented by a single image. Despite being informative, these techniques remain limited as they ignore multivariate relationships in the data. Most importantly, the commonly employed local Gaussian smoothing, which is important for accounting for registration errors and making the data follow Gaussian distributions, is usually chosen in an ad hoc fashion. Thus, it is often suboptimal for the task of detecting group differences and correlations with non-imaging variables. Information mapping techniques, such as searchlight, which use pattern classifiers to exploit multivariate information and obtain more powerful statistical maps, have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, existing methods may lead to important interpretation errors in practice ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}i.e.{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, misidentifying a cluster as informative, or failing to detect truly informative voxels), while often being computationally expensive. To address these issues, we introduce a novel efficient multivariate statistical framework for cross-sectional studies, termed MIDAS, seeking highly sensitive and specific voxel-wise brain maps, while leveraging the power of regional discriminant analysis. In MIDAS, locally linear discriminative learning is applied to estimate the pattern that best discriminates between two groups, or predicts a variable of interest. This pattern is equivalent to local filtering by an optimal kernel whose coefficients are the weights of the linear discriminant. By composing information from all neighborhoods that contain a given voxel, MIDAS produces a statistic that collectively reflects the contribution of the voxel to the regional classifiers as well as the discriminative power of the classifiers. Critically, MIDAS efficiently assesses the statistical significance of the derived statistic by analytically approximating its null distribution without the need for computationally expensive permutation tests. The proposed framework was extensively validated using simulated atrophy in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and further tested using data from a task-based functional MRI study as well as a structural MRI study of cognitive performance. The performance of the proposed framework was evaluated against standard voxel-wise general linear models and other information mapping methods. The experimental results showed that MIDAS achieves relatively higher sensitivity and specificity in detecting group differences. Together, our results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach to efficiently map effects of interest in both structural and functional data.},

In this article we will consider some of the early forays into Bayes and what motivated its use. We shall see the impact that Bayes has had on haemodynamic modelling, spatial modelling, group analysis, model selection and brain connectivity analysis; and consider how these advancements have spun-off into related areas of neuroscience and some of the challenges that remain. Bayes has brought to the table inference flexibility, incorporation of prior information, adaptive regularisation and model selection. But perhaps more important than these things, is the ability of Bayes to empower the methods researcher with a mathematically principled framework for inferring on any model. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), the correlation between blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals across different brain regions is used to estimate the functional connectivity of the brain. This approach has led to the identification of a number of resting-state networks, including the default mode network (DMN) and the task positive network (TPN). Global signal regression (GSR) is a widely used pre-processing step in rsfMRI that has been shown to improve the spatial specificity of the estimated resting-state networks. In GSR, a whole brain average time series, known as the global signal (GS), is regressed out of each voxel time series prior to the computation of the correlations. However, the use of GSR is controversial because it can introduce artifactual negative correlations. For example, it has been argued that anticorrelations observed between the DMN and TPN are primarily an artifact of GSR. Despite the concerns about GSR, there is currently no consensus regarding its use. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for understanding the effects of GSR. In particular, we show that the main effects of GSR can be well approximated as a temporal downweighting process in which the data from time points with relatively large GS magnitudes are greatly attenuated while data from time points with relatively small GS magnitudes are largely unaffected. Furthermore, we show that a limiting case of this downweighting process in which data from time points with large GS magnitudes are censored can also approximate the effects of GSR. In other words, the correlation maps obtained after GSR show a high degree of spatial similarity (including the presence of anticorrelations between the DMN and TPN) with maps obtained using only the uncensored (i.e. retained) time points. Since the data from these retained time points are unaffected by the censoring process, this finding suggests that the observed anticorrelations inherently exist in the data from time points with small GS magnitudes and are not simply an artifact of GSR.},

abstract = {A challenging goal in neuroscience is to be able to read out, or decode, mental content from brain activity. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have decoded orientation, position and object category from activity in visual cortex. However, these studies typically used relatively simple stimuli (for example, gratings) or images drawn from fixed categories (for example, faces, houses), and decoding was based on previous measurements of brain activity evoked by those same stimuli or categories. To overcome these limitations, here we develop a decoding method based on quantitative receptive-field models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli and fMRI activity in early visual areas. These models describe the tuning of individual voxels for space, orientation and spatial frequency, and are estimated directly from responses evoked by natural images. We show that these receptive-field models make it possible to identify, from a large set of completely novel natural images, which specific image was seen by an observer. Identification is not a mere consequence of the retinotopic organization of visual areas; simpler receptive-field models that describe only spatial tuning yield much poorer identification performance. Our results suggest that it may soon be possible to reconstruct a picture of a person's visual experience from measurements of brain activity alone.},

abstract = {During the last several years, the focus of research on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shifted from the analysis of functional connectivity averaged over the duration of scanning sessions to the analysis of changes of functional connectivity within sessions. Although several studies have reported the presence of dynamic functional connectivity (dFC), statistical assessment of the results is not always carried out in a sound way and, in some studies, is even omitted. In this study, we explain why appropriate statistical tests are needed to detect dFC, we describe how they can be carried out and how to assess the performance of dFC measures, and we illustrate the methodology using spontaneous blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI recordings of macaque monkeys under general anesthesia and in human subjects under resting-state conditions. We mainly focus on sliding-window correlations since these are most widely used in assessing dFC, but also consider a recently proposed non-linear measure. The simulations and methodology, however, are general and can be applied to any measure. The results are twofold. First, through simulations, we show that in typical resting-state sessions of 10 min, it is almost impossible to detect dFC using sliding-window correlations. This prediction is validated by both the macaque and the human data: in none of the individual recording sessions was evidence for dFC found. Second, detection power can be considerably increased by session- or subject-averaging of the measures. In doing so, we found that most of the functional connections are in fact dynamic. With this study, we hope to raise awareness of the statistical pitfalls in the assessment of dFC and how they can be avoided by using appropriate statistical methods.},

abstract = {Multi-modal imaging is now well-established in routine clinical practice. Especially in the field of Nuclear Medicine, new PET installations are comprised almost exclusively of combined PET/CT scanners rather than PET-only systems. However, PET/CT has certain notable shortcomings, including the inability to perform simultaneous data acquisition and the significant radiation dose to the patient contributed by CT. MRI offers, compared to CT, better contrast among soft tissues as well as functional-imaging capabilities. Therefore, the combination of PET with MRI provides many advantages which go far beyond simply combining functional PET information with structural MRI information. Many technical challenges, including possible interference between these modalities, have to be solved when combining PET and MRI and various approaches have been adapted to resolving these issues. Here we present an overview of current working prototypes of combined PET/ MRI scanners from different groups. In addition, besides PET/MR images of mice, the first such images of a rat PET/MR, acquired with the first commercial clinical PET/MRI scanner, are presented. The combination of PET and MR is a promising tool in pre-clinical research and will certainly progress to clinical application. INTRODUCTION},

Figures 1 and 2 of ref. 1 actually show similar FPRs for AFNI, FSL-OLS, and SPM: Most tests were in a range of 20 − 40{\%} FPR at P = 0.01 and 5 − 15{\%} FPR at P = 0.001 (nor did their famous 70{\%} FPR come from AFNI). The data given in the Results section of ref. 1 simply do not support the statement in the Discussion section that AFNI had " particularly high " FPRs.},

abstract = {With the increasing life expectancy in developed countries, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and thus its socioeconomic impact are growing. Increasing knowledge over the last years about the pathomechanisms involved in AD allow for the development of specific treatment strategies aimed at slowing down or even preventing neuronal death in AD. However, this requires also that (1) AD can be diagnosed with high accuracy, because non-AD dementias would not benefit from an AD-specific treatment; (2) AD can be diagnosed in very early stages when any intervention would be most effective; and (3) treatment efficacy can be reliably and meaningfully monitored. Although there currently is no ideal biomarker that would fulfill all these requirements, there is increasing evidence that a combination of currently existing neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood biomarkers can provide important complementary information and thus contribute to a more accurate and earlier diagnosis of AD. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is exploring which combinations of these biomarkers are the most powerful for diagnosis of AD and monitoring of treatment effects.},

Given the individual classes in the model, the data are typically modeled as Gaussian random variates or as random variates from some other parametric distribution. In this article, we present a non-parametric Potts model and apply it to a functional magnetic resonance imaging study for the pre-surgical assessment of peritumoral brain activation. In our model, we assume that the Z-score image from a patient can be segmented into activated, deactivated, and null classes, or states. Conditional on the class, or state, the Z-scores are assumed to come from some generic distribution which we model non-parametrically using a mixture of Dirichlet process priors within the Bayesian framework. The posterior distribution of the model parameters is estimated with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, and Bayesian decision theory is used to make the final classifications. Our Potts prior model includes two parameters, the standard spatial regularization parameter and a parameter that can be interpreted as the a priori probability that each voxel belongs to the null, or background state, conditional on the lack of spatial regularization. We assume that both of these parameters are unknown, and jointly estimate them along with other model parameters. We show through simulation studies that our model performs on par, in terms of posterior expected loss, with parametric Potts models when the parametric model is correctly specified and outperforms parametric models when the parametric model in misspecified.},

This potential is limited by uncertainties in assessing the significance of these maps. In this report, we describe an approach that may partially resolve this issue. A distinction is made between using SPMs as images of change significance and using them to identify foci of significant change. In the first case, the SPM can be reported nonselectively as a single mathematical object with its omnibus significance. Alternatively, the SPM constitutes a large number of repeated measures over the brain. To reject the null hypothesis, that no change has occurred at a specific location, a threshold adjustment must be made that accounts for the large number of comparisons made. This adjustment is shown to depend on the SPM's smoothness. Smoothness can be determined empirically and be used to calculate a threshold required to identify significant foci. The approach models the SPM as a stationary stochastic process. The theory and applications are illustrated using uniform phantom images and data from a verbal fluency activation study of four normal subjects.},

This might be the inference of percent changes in blood flow in perfusion FMRI data, segmentation of subcortical structures from structural MRI, or inference of the probability of an anatomical connection between an area of cortex and a subthalamic nucleus using diffusion MRI. In this article we will describe how Bayesian techniques have made a significant impact in tackling problems such as these, particularly in regards to the analysis tools in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL). We shall see how Bayes provides a framework within which we can attempt to infer on models of neuroimaging data, while allowing us to incorporate our prior belief about the brain and the neuroimaging equipment in the form of biophysically informed or regularising priors. It allows us to extract probabilistic information from the data, and to probabilistically combine information from multiple modalities. Bayes can also be used to not only compare and select between models of different complexity, but also to infer on data using committees of models. Finally, we mention some analysis scenarios where Bayesian methods are impractical, and briefly discuss some practical approaches that we have taken in these cases.},

abstract = {Resting-state functional connectivity is a powerful tool for studying human functional brain networks. Temporal fluctuations in functional connectivity, i.e., dynamic functional connectivity (dFC), are thought to reflect dynamic changes in brain organization and non-stationary switching of discrete brain states. However, recent studies have suggested that dFC might be attributed to sampling variability of static FC. Despite this controversy, a detailed exposition of stationarity and statistical testing of dFC is lacking in the literature. This article seeks an in-depth exploration of these statistical issues at a level appealing to both neuroscientists and statisticians. We first review the statistical notion of stationarity, emphasizing its reliance on ensemble statistics. In contrast, all FC measures depend on sample statistics. An important consequence is that the space of stationary signals is much broader than expected, e.g., encompassing hidden markov models (HMM) widely used to extract discrete brain states. In other words, stationarity does not imply the absence of brain states. We then expound the assumptions underlying the statistical testing of dFC. It turns out that the two popular frameworks - phase randomization (PR) and autoregressive randomization (ARR) - generate stationary, linear, Gaussian null data. Therefore, statistical rejection can be due to non-stationarity, nonlinearity and/or non-Gaussianity. For example, the null hypothesis can be rejected for the stationary HMM due to nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity. Finally, we show that a common form of ARR (bivariate ARR) is susceptible to false positives compared with PR and an adapted version of ARR (multivariate ARR). Application of PR and multivariate ARR to Human Connectome Project data suggests that the stationary, linear, Gaussian null hypothesis cannot be rejected for most participants. However, failure to reject the null hypothesis does not imply that static FC can fully explain dFC. We find that first order AR models explain temporal FC fluctuations significantly better than static FC models. Since first order AR models encode both static FC and one-lag FC, this suggests the presence of dynamical information beyond static FC. Furthermore, even in subjects where the null hypothesis was rejected, AR models explain temporal FC fluctuations significantly better than a popular HMM, suggesting the lack of discrete states (as measured by resting-state fMRI). Overall, our results suggest that AR models are not only useful as a means for generating null data, but may be a powerful tool for exploring the dynamical properties of resting-state fMRI. Finally, we discuss how apparent contradictions in the growing dFC literature might be reconciled. • Space of stationary models bigger than expected; includes hidden Markov model (HMM).• Phase {\&} autoregressive randomizations test for stationarity, linearity, Gaussianity.• Resting-state fMRI is mostly stationary, linear, and Gaussian.• 1st order autoregressive (AR) model encodes static {\&} one-lag FC.• 1st order AR model explains sliding window correlations very well, better than HMM.},

abstract = {Despite a growing body of research suggesting that task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies often suffer from a lack of statistical power due to too-small samples, the proliferation of such underpowered studies continues unabated. Using large independent samples across four distinct tasks, we demonstrate the impact of sample size on reproducibility, assessed at different levels of analysis relevant to fMRI researchers. We find that typical sample sizes produce results that have a low degree of reproducibility, and even samples much larger than typical (e.g., N = 100) produce results that are far from perfectly reproducible. Thus, our results join the existing line of work advocating for larger sample sizes. Moreover, because we test sample sizes over a fairly large range and use intuitive metrics of reproducibility, our hope is that our results help catalyze a major shift in how task-based fMRI research is carried out across the entire field.},

abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) can be applied to study the functional connectivity of the human brain. It has been suggested that fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal during rest reflect the neuronal baseline activity of the brain, representing the state of the human brain in the absence of goal-directed neuronal action and external input, and that these slow fluctuations correspond to functionally relevant resting-state networks. Several studies on resting fMRI have been conducted, reporting an apparent similarity between the identified patterns. The spatial consistency of these resting patterns, however, has not yet been evaluated and quantified. In this study, we apply a data analysis approach called tensor probabilistic independent component analysis to resting-state fMRI data to find coherencies that are consistent across subjects and sessions. We characterize and quantify the consistency of these effects by using a bootstrapping approach, and we estimate the BOLD amplitude modulation as well as the voxel-wise cross-subject variation. The analysis found 10 patterns with potential functional relevance, consisting of regions known to be involved in motor function, visual processing, executive functioning, auditory processing, memory, and the so-called default-mode network, each with BOLD signal changes up to 3{\%}. In general, areas with a high mean percentage BOLD signal are consistent and show the least variation around the mean. These findings show that the baseline activity of the brain is consistent across subjects exhibiting significant temporal dynamics, with percentage BOLD signal change comparable with the signal changes found in task-related experiments.},

abstract = {Incomplete or missing data is typical in neuroimaging datasets. With fMRI, acquisition artifacts can corrupt individual voxels or entire planes. In PET, poor patient positioning can result in some subjects missing some of their temporal or dorsal cortices. When some voxels are missing, the standard procedure is to mask out any voxel with any missing data, forgoing results for those voxels. Here we use results from the theory of missing data to make best use of all information collected. Specifically we describe the conditions that must hold such that an intuitive “complete case” analysis can be used, and demonstrate the method on a FDG-PET dataset. We further show that there are other problems when data are smoothed Our complete-case analysis method solves the missing data problem in neuroimaging under either MCAR or MAR conditions. The method is straightforward, though does require fitting different design matricies each voxel, discarding subjects with missing data. Voxels with partially complete data will have less precise parameter estimates, but the SDIF can be computed and used to gauge the severity of the problem. Standard smoothing creates data outside of the brain and outside of the mask of non-missing data. A truncated kernel smoother, followed by masking of missing voxels, avoids these problems. When combined with a complete case analysis, this approach provides optimally valid results.},

@article{Friston2002b,
abstract = {In Friston et al. ((2002) Neuroimage 16: 465-483) we introduced empirical Bayes as a potentially useful way to estimate and make inferences about effects in hierarchical models. In this paper we present a series of models that exemplify the diversity of problems that can be addressed within this framework. In hierarchical linear observation models, both classical and empirical Bayesian approaches can be framed in terms of covariance component estimation (e.g., variance partitioning). To illustrate the use of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in covariance component estimation we focus first on two important problems in fMRI: nonsphericity induced by (i) serial or temporal correlations among errors and (ii) variance components caused by the hierarchical nature of multisubject studies. In hierarchical observation models, variance components at higher levels can be used as constraints on the parameter estimates of lower levels. This enables the use of parametric empirical Bayesian (PEB) estimators, as distinct from classical maximum likelihood (ML) estimates. We develop this distinction to address: (i) The difference between response estimates based on ML and the conditional means from a Bayesian approach and the implications for estimates of intersubject variability. (ii) The relationship between fixed- and random-effect analyses. (iii) The specificity and sensitivity of Bayesian inference and, finally, (iv) the relative importance of the number of scans and subjects. The forgoing is concerned with within- and between-subject variability in multisubject hierarchical fMRI studies. In the second half of this paper we turn to Bayesian inference at the first (within-voxel) level, using PET data to show how priors can be derived from the (between-voxel) distribution of activations over the brain. This application uses exactly the same ideas and formalism but, in this instance, the second level is provided by observations over voxels as opposed to subjects. The ensuing posterior probability maps (PPMs) have enhanced anatomical precision and greater face validity, in relation to underlying anatomy. Furthermore, in comparison to conventional SPMs they are not confounded by the multiple comparison problem that, in a classical context, dictates high thresholds and low sensitivity. We conclude with some general comments on Bayesian approaches to image analysis and on some unresolved issues.},

This variability is often attributed to volatile factors, such as task strategy or compliance. We propose that individual differences in brain responses are, to a large degree, inherent to the brain and can be predicted from task-independent measurements collected at rest. Using a large set of task conditions, spanning several behavioral domains, we train a simple model that relates task-independent measurements to task activity and evaluate the model by predicting task activation maps for unseen subjects using magnetic resonance imaging. Our model can accurately predict individual differences in brain activity and highlights a coupling between brain connectivity and function that can be captured at the level of individual subjects.},

In this work, we propose a full Bayesian procedure to analyze fMRI data for individual and group stages. For the individual stage we use a multivariate dynamic linear model (MDLM), where the temporal dependence is modeled through the state parameters and the spatial dependence is modeled only locally, taking the nearest neighbors of each voxel location. For the group stage we take advantage of the posterior distribution of the state parameters obtained in the individual stage and create a new posterior distribution that represents the updated beliefs for the group analysis. Since the posterior distribution for the state parameters is indexed by the time {\$}t{\$}, we propose an algorithm that allows on-line estimated curves of the state parameters to be drawn and posterior probabilities computed in order to assess brain activation for both individual and group analysis. We propose an alternative analysis for the group stage using a Gaussian process ANOVA model, where the on-line estimated curves obtained in the individual stage are modeled as a functional response. Finally, we assess our proposed modeling procedure using real resting-state data and computing empirical false-positive brain activation rates.},

In this paper we present a series of models that exemplify the diversity of problems that can be addressed within this framework. In hierarchical linear observation models, both classical and empirical Bayesian approaches can be framed in terms of covariance component estimation (e.g., variance partitioning). To illustrate the use of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in covariance component estimation we focus first on two important problems in fMRI: nonsphericity induced by (i) serial or temporal correlations among errors and (ii) variance components caused by the hierarchical nature of multisubject studies. In hierarchical observation models, variance components at higher levels can be used as constraints on the parameter estimates of lower levels. This enables the use of parametric empirical Bayesian (PEB) estimators, as distinct from classical maximum likelihood (ML) estimates. We develop this distinction to address: (i) The difference between response estimates based on ML and the conditional means from a Bayesian approach and the implications for estimates of intersubject variability. (ii) The relationship between fixed- and random-effect analyses. (iii) The specificity and sensitivity of Bayesian inference and, finally, (iv) the relative importance of the number of scans and subjects. The forgoing is concerned with within- and between-subject variability in multisubject hierarchical fMRI studies. In the second half of this paper we turn to Bayesian inference at the first (within-voxel) level, using PET data to show how priors can be derived from the (between-voxel) distribution of activations over the brain. This application uses exactly the same ideas and formalism but, in this instance, the second level is provided by observations over voxels as opposed to subjects. The ensuing posterior probability maps (PPMs) have enhanced anatomical precision and greater face validity, in relation to underlying anatomy.

abstract = {Mounting evidence over the last few years suggest that published neuroscience research suffer from low power, and especially for published fMRI experiments. Not only does low power decrease the chance of detecting a true effect, it also reduces the chance that a statistically significant result indicates a true effect (Ioannidis, 2005). Put another way, findings with the least power will be the least reproducible, and thus a (prospective) power analysis is a critical component of any paper. In this work we present a simple way to characterize the spatial signal in a fMRI study with just two parameters, and a direct way to estimate these two parameters based on an existing study. Specifically, using just (1) the proportion of the brain activated and (2) the average effect size in activated brain regions, we can produce closed form power calculations for given sample size, brain volume and smoothness. This procedure allows one to minimize the cost of an fMRI experiment, while preserving a predefined statistical power. The method is evaluated and illustrated using simulations and real neuroimaging data from the Human Connectome Project. The procedures presented in this paper are made publicly available in an online web-based toolbox available at www.neuropowertools.org.},

abstract = {In this work, we show how permutation methods can be applied to combination analyses such as those that include multiple imaging modalities, multiple data acquisitions of the same modality, or simply multiple hypotheses on the same data. Using the well-known definition of union-intersection tests and closed testing procedures, we use synchronized permutations to correct for such multiplicity of tests, allowing flexibility to integrate imaging data with different spatial resolutions, surface and/or volume-based representations of the brain, including non-imaging data. For the problem of joint inference, we propose and evaluate a modification of the recently introduced non-parametric combination (NPC) methodology, such that instead of a two-phase algorithm and large data storage requirements, the inference can be performed in a single phase, with reasonable computational demands. The method compares favorably to classical multivariate tests (such as MANCOVA), even when the latter is assessed using permutations. We also evaluate, in the context of permutation tests, various combining methods that have been proposed in the past decades, and identify those that provide the best control over error rate and power across a range of situations. We show that one of these, the method of Tippett, provides a link between correction for the multiplicity of tests and their combination. Finally, we discuss how the correction can solve certain problems of multiple comparisons in one-way ANOVA designs, and how the combination is distinguished from conjunctions, even though both can be assessed using permutation tests. We also provide a common algorithm that accommodates combination and correction. Hum Brain Mapp 37:1486-1511, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The analysis of functional mapping experiments in positron emission tomography involves the formation of images displaying the values of a suitable statistic, summarising the evidence in the data for a particular effect at each voxel. These statistic images must then be scrutinised to locate regions showing statistically significant effects. The methods most commonly used are parametric, assuming a particular form of probability distribution for the voxel values in the statistic image. Scientific hypotheses, formulated in terms of parameters describing these distributions, are then tested on the basis of the assumptions. Images of statistics are usually considered as lattice representations of continuous random fields. These are more amenable to statistical analysis. There are various shortcomings associated with these methods of analysis. The many assumptions and approximations involved may not be true. The low numbers of subjects and scans, in typical experiments, lead to noisy statistic images with low degrees of freedom, which are not well approximated by continuous random fields. Thus, the methods are only approximately valid at best and are most suspect in single-subject studies. In contrast to the existing methods, we present a nonparametric approach to significance testing for statistic images from activation studies. Formal assumptions are replaced by a computationally expensive approach. In a simple rest-activation study, if there is really no activation effect, the labelling of the scans as "active" or "rest" is artificial, and a statistic image formed with some other labelling is as likely as the observed one. Thus, considering all possible relabellings, a p value can be computed for any suitable statistic describing the statistic image. Consideration of the maximal statistic leads to a simple nonparametric single-threshold test. This randomisation test relies only on minimal assumptions about the design of the experiment, is (almost) exact, with Type I error (almost) exactly that specified, and hence is always valid. The absence of distributional assumptions permits the consideration of a wide range of test statistics, for instance, "pseudo" t statistic images formed with smoothed variance images. The approach presented extends easily to other paradigms, permitting nonparametric analysis of most functional mapping experiments. When the assumptions of the parametric methods are true, these new nonparametric methods, at worst, provide for their validation. When the assumptions of the parametric methods are dubious, the nonparametric methods provide the only analysis that can be guaranteed valid and exact.},

Here we examine brain white matter magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in 3,513 generally healthy people aged 44.64-77.12 years from the UK Biobank. Using conventional water diffusion measures and newer, rarely studied indices from neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging, we document large age associations with white matter microstructure. Mean diffusivity is the most age-sensitive measure, with negative age associations strongest in the thalamic radiation and association fibres. White matter microstructure across brain tracts becomes increasingly correlated in older age. This may reflect an age-related aggregation of systemic detrimental effects. We report several other novel results, including age associations with hemisphere and sex, and comparative volumetric MRI analyses. Results from this unusually large, single-scanner sample provide one of the most extensive characterizations of age associations with major white matter tracts in the human brain.},

abstract = {Representational similarity analysis of activation patterns has become an increasingly important tool for studying brain representations. The dissimilarity between two patterns is commonly quantified by the correlation distance or the accuracy of a linear classifier. However, there are many different ways to measure pattern dissimilarity and little is known about their relative reliability. Here, we compare the reliability of three classes of dissimilarity measure: classification accuracy, Euclidean/Mahalanobis distance, and Pearson correlation distance. Using simulations and four real functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets, we demonstrate that continuous dissimilarity measures are substantially more reliable than the classification accuracy. The difference in reliability can be explained by two characteristics of classifiers: discretization and susceptibility of the discriminant function to shifts of the pattern ensemble between imaging runs. Reliability can be further improved through multivariate noise normalization for all measures. Finally, unlike conventional distance measures, crossvalidated distances provide unbiased estimates of pattern dissimilarity on a ratio scale, thus providing an interpretable zero point. Overall, our results indicate that the crossvalidated Mahalanobis distance is preferable to both the classification accuracy and the correlation distance for characterizing representational geometries.},

abstract = {In logic a conjunction is defined as an AND between truth statements. In neuroimaging, investigators may look for brain areas activated by task A AND by task B, or a conjunction of tasks (Price, C.J., Friston, K.J., 1997. Cognitive conjunction: a new approach to brain activation experiments. NeuroImage 5, 261-270). Friston et al. (Friston, K., Holmes, A., Price, C., B{\"{u}}chel, C., Worsley, K., 1999. Multisubject fMRI studies and conjunction analyses. NeuroImage 10, 85-396) introduced a minimum statistic test for conjunction. We refer to this method as the minimum statistic compared to the global null (MS/GN). The MS/GN is implemented in SPM2 and SPM99 software, and has been widely used as a test of conjunction. However, we assert that it does not have the correct null hypothesis for a test of logical AND, and further, this has led to confusion in the neuroimaging community. In this paper, we define a conjunction and explain the problem with the MS/GN test as a conjunction method. We present a survey of recent practice in neuroimaging which reveals that the MS/GN test is very often misinterpreted as evidence of a logical AND. We show that a correct test for a logical AND requires that all the comparisons in the conjunction are individually significant. This result holds even if the comparisons are not independent. We suggest that the revised test proposed here is the appropriate means for conjunction inference in neuroimaging. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Machine learning analysis of neuroimaging data can accurately predict chronological age in healthy people. Deviations from healthy brain ageing have been associated with cognitive impairment and disease. Here we sought to further establish the credentials of ‘brain-predicted age' as a biomarker of individual differences in the brain ageing process, using a predictive modelling approach based on deep learning, and specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), and applied to both pre-processed and raw T1-weighted MRI data. Firstly, we aimed to demonstrate the accuracy of CNN brain-predicted age using a large dataset of healthy adults (N = 2001). Next, we sought to establish the heritability of brain-predicted age using a sample of monozygotic and dizygotic female twins (N = 62). Thirdly, we examined the test-retest and multi-centre reliability of brain-predicted age using two samples (within-scanner N = 20; between-scanner N = 11). CNN brain-predicted ages were generated and compared to a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) approach, on all datasets. Input data were grey matter (GM) or white matter (WM) volumetric maps generated by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) or raw data. CNN accurately predicted chronological age using GM (correlation between brain-predicted age and chronological age r = 0.96, mean absolute error [MAE] = 4.16 years) and raw (r = 0.94, MAE = 4.65 years) data. This was comparable to GPR brain-predicted age using GM data (r = 0.95, MAE = 4.66 years). Brain-predicted age was a heritable phenotype for all models and input data (h2≥ 0.5). Brain-predicted age showed high test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.90–0.99). Multi-centre reliability was more variable within high ICCs for GM (0.83–0.96) and poor-moderate levels for WM and raw data (0.51–0.77). Brain-predicted age represents an accurate, highly reliable and genetically-influenced phenotype, that has potential to be used as a biomarker of brain ageing. Moreover, age predictions can be accurately generated on raw T1-MRI data, substantially reducing computation time for novel data, bringing the process closer to giving real-time information on brain health in clinical settings.},

abstract = {Fast imaging methods and the availability of required hardware for magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) have significantly reduced acquisition times from about an hour down to several minutes or seconds. With this development over the last 20 years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become one of the most important instruments in clinical diagnosis. In recent years, the greatest progress in further increasing imaging speed has been the development of parallel MRI (pMRI). Within the last 3 years, parallel imaging methods have become commercially available, and therefore are now available for a broad clinical use. The basic feature of pMRI is a scan time reduction, applicable to nearly any available MRI method, while maintaining the contrast behavior without requiring higher gradient system performance. Because of its faster image acquisition, pMRI can in some cases even significantly improve image quality. In the last 10 years of pMRI development, several different pMRI reconstruction methods have been set up which partially differ in their philosophy, in the mode of reconstruction as well in their advantages and drawbacks with regard to a successful image reconstruction. In this review, a brief overview is given on the advantages and disadvantages of present pMRI methods in clinical applications, and examples from different daily clinical applications are shown.},

In particular, we show that a two-level mixed-effects model (where parameters of interest at the group level are estimated from parameter and variance estimates from the single-session level) can be made equivalent to a single complete mixed-effects model (where parameters of interest at the group level are estimated directly from all of the original single-sessions' time-series data) if the (co-)variance at the second level is set equal to the sum of the (co-)variances in the single-level form, using the BLUE with known covariances. This result has significant implications for group studies in FMRI, since it shows that the group analysis only requires values of the parameter estimates and their (co-)variance from the first level, generalising the well established 'summary statistics' approach in FMRI. The simple and generalised framework allows for different pre-whitening and different first-level regressors to be used for each subject. The framework incorporates multiple levels and cases such as repeated measures, paired or unpaired t-tests and F-tests at the group level; explicit examples of such models are given in the paper. Using numerical simulations based on typical first level covariance structures from real FMRI data we demonstrate that by taking into account lower-level covariances and heterogeneity a substantial increase in higher-level Z-score is possible.},

abstract = {Increasingly-large datasets (for example, the resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project) are demanding analyses that are problematic because of the sheer scale of the aggregate data. We present two approaches for applying group-level PCA; both give a close approximation to the output of PCA applied to full concatenation of all individual datasets, while having very low memory requirements regardless of the number of datasets being combined. Across a range of realistic simulations, we find that in most situations, both methods are more accurate than current popular approaches for analysis of multi-subject resting-state fMRI studies. The group-PCA output can be used to feed into a range of further analyses that are then rendered practical, such as the estimation of group-averaged voxelwise connectivity, group-level parcellation, and group-ICA.},

@article{Nandy2007,
abstract = {One of the most important considerations in any hypothesis based fMRI data analysis is to choose the appropriate threshold to construct the activation maps, which is usually based on p-values. However, in fMRI data, there are three factors which necessitate severe corrections in the process of estimating the p-values. First, the fMRI time series at an individual voxel has strong temporal autocorrelation which needs to be estimated to obtain the corrected parametric p-value. The second factor is the multiple comparisons problem arising from simultaneously testing tens of thousands of voxels for activation. A common way in the statistical literature to account for multiple testing is to consider the family-wise error rate (FWE) which is related to the distribution of the maximum observed value over all voxels. The third problem, which is not mentioned frequently in the context of adjusting the p-value, is the effect of inherent low frequency processes present even in resting-state data that may introduce a large number of false positives without proper adjustment. In this article, a novel and efficient semi-parametric method, using resampling of normalized spacings of order statistics, is introduced to address all the three problems mentioned above. The new method makes very few assumptions and demands minimal computational effort, unlike other existing resampling methods in fMRI. Furthermore, it will be demonstrated that the correction for temporal autocorrelation is not critical in implementing the proposed method. Results using the proposed method are compared with SPM2. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of neuroimaging research and accumulation of neuroinformatic databases the synthesis of consensus findings using meta-analysis is becoming increasingly important. Meta-analyses pool data across many studies to identify reliable experimental effects and characterize the degree of agreement across studies. Coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) methods are the standard approach, where each study entered into the meta-analysis has been summarized using only the (x, y, z) locations of peak activations (with or without activation magnitude) reported in published reports. Image-based meta-analysis (IBMA) methods use the full statistic images, and allow the use of hierarchical mixed effects models that account for differing intra-study variance and modeling of random inter-study variation. The purpose of this work is to compare image-based and coordinate-based meta-analysis methods applied to the same dataset, a group of 15 fMRI studies of pain, and to quantify the information lost by working only with the coordinates of peak activations instead of the full statistic images. We apply a 3-level IBMA mixed model for a "mega-analysis", and highlight important considerations in the specification of each model and contrast. We compare the IBMA result to three CBMA methods: ALE (activation likelihood estimation), KDA (kernel density analysis) and MKDA (multi-level kernel density analysis), for various CBMA smoothing parameters. For the datasets considered, we find that ALE at ?? = 15??mm, KDA at ?? = 25-30??mm and MKDA at ?? = 15??mm give the greatest similarity to the IBMA result, and that ALE was the most similar for this particular dataset, though only with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.45 (Dice measure ranges from 0 to 1). Based on this poor similarity, and the greater modeling flexibility afforded by hierarchical mixed models, we suggest that IBMA is preferred over CBMA. To make IBMA analyses practical, however, the neuroimaging field needs to develop an effective mechanism for sharing image data, including whole-brain images of both effect estimates and their standard errors. ?? 2008.},

abstract = {Parallel imaging has been the single biggest innovation in magnetic resonance imaging in the last decade. The use of multiple receiver coils to augment the time consuming Fourier encoding has reduced acquisition times significantly. This increase in speed comes at a time when other approaches to acquisition time reduction were reaching engineering and human limits. A brief summary of spatial encoding in MRI is followed by an introduction to the problem parallel imaging is designed to solve. There are a large number of parallel reconstruction algorithms; this article reviews a cross-section, SENSE, SMASH, g-SMASH and GRAPPA, selected to demonstrate the different approaches. Theoretical (the g-factor) and practical (coil design) limits to acquisition speed are reviewed. The practical implementation of parallel imaging is also discussed, in particular coil calibration. How to recognize potential failure modes and their associated artefacts are shown. Well-established applications including angiography, cardiac imaging and applications using echo planar imaging are reviewed and we discuss what makes a good application for parallel imaging. Finally, active research areas where parallel imaging is being used to improve data quality by repairing artefacted images are also reviewed.},

@article{Bansal2018,
abstract = {Identifying regional effects of interest in MRI datasets usually entails testing a priori hypotheses across many thousands of brain voxels, requiring control for false positive findings in these multiple hypotheses testing. Recent studies have suggested that parametric statistical methods may have incorrectly modeled functional MRI data, thereby leading to higher false positive rates than their nominal rates. Nonparametric methods for statistical inference when conducting multiple statistical tests, in contrast, are thought to produce false positives at the nominal rate, which has thus led to the suggestion that previously reported studies should reanalyze their fMRI data using nonparametric tools. To understand better why parametric methods may yield excessive false positives, we assessed their performance when applied both to simulated datasets of 1D, 2D, and 3D Gaussian Random Fields (GRFs) and to 710 real-world, resting-state fMRI datasets. We showed that both the simulated 2D and 3D GRFs and the real-world data contain a small percentage ({\textless}6{\%}) of very large clusters (on average 60 times larger than the average cluster size), which were not present in 1D GRFs. These unexpectedly large clusters were deemed statistically significant using parametric methods, leading to empirical familywise error rates (FWERs) as high as 65{\%}: the high empirical FWERs were not a consequence of parametric methods failing to model spatial smoothness accurately, but rather of these very large clusters that are inherently present in smooth, high-dimensional random fields. In fact, when discounting these very large clusters, the empirical FWER for parametric methods was 3.24{\%}. Furthermore, even an empirical FWER of 65{\%} would yield on average less than one of those very large clusters in each brain-wide analysis. Nonparametric methods, in contrast, estimated distributions from those large clusters, and therefore, by construct rejected the large clusters as false positives at the nominal FWERs. Those rejected clusters were outlying values in the distribution of cluster size but cannot be distinguished from true positive findings without further analyses, including assessing whether fMRI signal in those regions correlates with other clinical, behavioral, or cognitive measures. Rejecting the large clusters, however, significantly reduced the statistical power of nonparametric methods in detecting true findings compared with parametric methods, which would have detected most true findings that are essential for making valid biological inferences in MRI data. Parametric analyses, in contrast, detected most true findings while generating relatively few false positives: on average, less than one of those very large clusters would be deemed a true finding in each brain-wide analysis. We therefore recommend the continued use of parametric methods that model nonstationary smoothness for cluster-level, familywise control of false positives, particularly when using a Cluster Defining Threshold of 2.5 or higher, and subsequently assessing rigorously the biological plausibility of the findings, even for large clusters. Finally, because nonparametric methods yielded a large reduction in statistical power to detect true positive findings, we conclude that the modest reduction in false positive findings that nonparametric analyses afford does not warrant a re-analysis of previously published fMRI studies using nonparametric techniques.},

@article{Beckmann2009,
abstract = {Introduction: Studies of resting-FMRI data increasingly often concern the estimation of differences between connectivity patterns, e.g. between different subject groups and/or between data sets obtained under different conditions such as pharmacological interventions. In this work we descibe an analysis approach which combines group-ICA with a dual regression approach in order to estimate such differences in functional connectivity. Methods: Initial data pre-processing involves correction for head motion, spatial and temporal filtering as well as co-registration of data to a common atlas space. The between subject analysis of the resting data then proceeds in three stages: Firstly, multiple FMRI data sets are concatenated temporally and ICA is applied in order to identify large-scale patterns of functional connectivity in the population (fig 1). Secondly, dual regression is used to identify, within each individual FMRI data set, corresponding temporal dynamics and associated spatial maps. This involves (A) using the group maps in a linear model fit, resulting in matrices describing temporal dynamics for each component and subject and (B) using these matrices in a linear model fit to estimate subject-specific spatial maps (fig 2). Finally, the different component maps are collected across subjects into single 4D files (one per original map) and analysed using parametric or non-parametric methods, e.g. GLM or permutation testing. This results in spatial maps characterising the between-subject/group differences (fig3). Results: The dual regression approach addresses a set of issues associated with alternative approaches for group resting-FMRI analysis. With respect to a seed-voxel based analysis approach the method promoted here does not rely on a single seed location but integrates the temporal information in the FMRI data across networks identified in the initial group ICA. The component maps of the initial ICA decomposition effectively define regions or networks of interest which are demonstrably relevant at the group level. Furthermore, this approach uses multiple linear regression instead of single regression and therefore can estimate significant differences in the presence of other sturctured effects in the data which otherwise might negatively impact such comparisons. With respect to alternative group-ICA methodology the approach presented here estimates spatial and temporal dynamics at the subject level based on regression against the original data rather than estimating subject-specific maps by means of 'back-projection' (see ref 4 for details). In the back- projection approach the estimated spatial maps necessarily lie within the space defined by the pseudo- inverse of the initial subject-specific major Eigenspaces (PCA) used for initial dimensionality-reduction. While this is computationally efficient, the final statistical comparison on the back-projected maps can become inaccurate as these maps can only represent the between-subject variation which falls within the initial PCA spaces. This is of particular importance as the effect differences can be small relative to the overall effect sizes. Conclusions: We have described an analysis approach which permits the identification of between- subject differences in resting functional connectivity based on between-subject similarities estimated within the framework of group-ICA. All the analysis steps can be carried out using tools from FSL. Further research using real and simulated data will allow for an assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of this technique.},

To protect against false positives, investigators have typically relied on decreasing the per pixel false positive probability. This approach incurs an inevitable loss of power to detect statistically significant activity. An alternative approach, which relies on the assumption that areas of true neural activity will tend to stimulate signal changes over contiguous pixels, is presented. If one knows the probability distribution of such cluster sizes as a function of per pixel false positive probability, one can use cluster-size thresholds independently to reject false positives. Both Monte Carlo simulations and fMRI studies of human subjects have been used to verify that this approach can improve statistical power by as much as fivefold over techniques that rely solely on adjusting per pixel false positive probabilities.},

Anatomical data such as structure masks, surface displacements, and deformation vectors are also highly nonisotropic.

We describe the motivation behind the project, focusing particularly on how this project addresses some of the well-known challenges to sharing of task-based fMRI data. Results from a preliminary analysis of the current database are presented, which demonstrate the ability to classify between task contrasts with high generalization accuracy across subjects, and the ability to identify individual subjects from their activation maps with moderately high accuracy. Clustering analyses show that the similarity relations between statistical maps have a somewhat orderly relation to the mental functions engaged by the relevant tasks.

abstract = {A recent paper by Eklund et al. (2012) showed that up to 70{\%} false positive results may occur when analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data using the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) software, which may mainly be caused by insufficient compensation for the temporal correlation between successive scans. Here, we show that a blockwise permutation method can be an effective alternative to the standard correction method for the correlated residuals in the general linear model, assuming an AR(1)-model as used in SPM for analyzing fMRI data. The blockwise permutation approach including a random shift developed by our group (Adolf et al., 2011) accounts for the temporal correlation structure of the data without having to provide a specific definition of the underlying autocorrelation model. 1465 publicly accessible resting-state data sets were re-analyzed, and the results were compared with those of Eklund et al. (2012). It was found that with the new permutation method the nominal familywise error rate for the detection of activated voxels could be maintained approximately under even the most critical conditions in which Eklund et al. found the largest deviations from the nominal error level. Thus, the method presented here can serve as a tool to ameliorate the quality and reliability of fMRI data analyses.},

abstract = {Most brain research to date have focused on studying the amplitude of evoked fMRI responses, though there has recently been an increased interest in measuring onset, peak latency and duration of the responses as well. A number of modeling procedures provide measures of the latency and duration of fMRI responses. In this work we compare several techniques that vary in their assumptions, model complexity, and interpretation. For each method, we introduce methods for estimating amplitude, peak latency, and duration and for performing inference in a multi-subject fMRI setting. We then assess the techniques' relative sensitivity and their propensity for mis-attributing task effects on one parameter (e.g., duration) to another (e.g., amplitude). Finally, we introduce methods for quantifying model misspecification and assessing bias and power-loss related to the choice of model. Overall, the results show that it is surprisingly difficult to accurately recover true task-evoked changes in BOLD signal and that there are substantial differences among models in terms of power, bias and parameter confusability. Because virtually all fMRI studies in cognitive and affective neuroscience employ these models, the results bear on the interpretation of hemodynamic response estimates across a wide variety of psychological and neuroscientific studies.},

abstract = {Permutation tests are amongst the most commonly used statistical tools in modern genomic research, a process by which p-values are attached to a test statistic by randomly permuting the sample or gene labels. Yet permutation p-values published in the genomic literature are often computed incorrectly, understated by about 1/m, where m is the number of permutations. The same is often true in the more general situation when Monte Carlo simulation is used to assign p-values. Although the p-value understatement is usually small in absolute terms, the implications can be serious in a multiple testing context. The understatement arises from the intuitive but mistaken idea of using permutation to estimate the tail probability of the test statistic. We argue instead that permutation should be viewed as generating an exact discrete null distribution. The relevant literature, some of which is likely to have been relatively inaccessible to the genomic community, is reviewed and summarized. A computation strategy is developed for exact p-values when permutations are randomly drawn. The strategy is valid for any number of permutations and samples. Some simple recommendations are made for the implementation of permutation tests in practice.},

abstract = {Because of their increased sensitivity to spatially extended signals, cluster-size tests are widely used to detect changes and activations in brain images. However, when images are nonstationary, the cluster-size distribution varies depending on local smoothness. Clusters tend to be large in smooth regions, resulting in increased false positives, while in rough regions, clusters tend to be small, resulting in decreased sensitivity. Worsley et al. proposed a random field theory (RFT) method that adjusts cluster sizes according to local roughness of images [Worsley, K.J., 2002. Nonstationary FWHM and its effect on statistical inference of fMRI data. Presented at the 8th International Conference on Functional Mapping of the Human Brain, June 2-6, 2002, Sendai, Japan. Available on CD-ROM in NeuroImage 16 (2) 779-780; Hum. Brain Mapp. 8 (1999) 98]. In this paper, we implement this method in a permutation test framework, which requires very few assumptions, is known to be exact [J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 16 (1996) 7] and is robust [NeuroImage 20 (2003) 2343]. We compared our method to stationary permutation, stationary RFT, and nonstationary RFT methods. Using simulated data, we found that our permutation test performs well under any setting examined, whereas the nonstationary RFT test performs well only for smooth images under high df. We also found that the stationary RFT test becomes anticonservative under nonstationarity, while both nonstationary RFT and permutation tests remain valid under nonstationarity. On a real PET data set we found that, though the nonstationary tests have reduced sensitivity due to smoothness estimation variability, these tests have better sensitivity for clusters in rough regions compared to stationary cluster-size tests. We include a detailed and consolidated description of Worsley nonstationary RFT cluster-size test. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Salimi2009,
abstract = {With the rapid growth of neuroimaging research and accumulation of neuroinformatic databases the synthesis of consensus findings using meta-analysis is becoming increasingly important. Meta-analyses pool data across many studies to identify reliable experimental effects and characterize the degree of agreement across studies. Coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) methods are the standard approach, where each study entered into the meta-analysis has been summarized using only the (x, y, z) locations of peak activations (with or without activation magnitude) reported in published reports. Image-based meta-analysis (IBMA) methods use the full statistic images, and allow the use of hierarchical mixed effects models that account for differing intra-study variance and modeling of random inter-study variation. The purpose of this work is to compare image-based and coordinate-based meta-analysis methods applied to the same dataset, a group of 15 fMRI studies of pain, and to quantify the information lost by working only with the coordinates of peak activations instead of the full statistic images. We apply a 3-level IBMA mixed model for a "mega-analysis", and highlight important considerations in the specification of each model and contrast. We compare the IBMA result to three CBMA methods: ALE (activation likelihood estimation), KDA (kernel density analysis) and MKDA (multi-level kernel density analysis), for various CBMA smoothing parameters. For the datasets considered, we find that ALE at ?? = 15??mm, KDA at ?? = 25-30??mm and MKDA at ?? = 15??mm give the greatest similarity to the IBMA result, and that ALE was the most similar for this particular dataset, though only with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.45 (Dice measure ranges from 0 to 1). Based on this poor similarity, and the greater modeling flexibility afforded by hierarchical mixed models, we suggest that IBMA is preferred over CBMA. To make IBMA analyses practical, however, the neuroimaging field needs to develop an effective mechanism for sharing image data, including whole-brain images of both effect estimates and their standard errors. ?? 2008.},

abstract = {Within the framework of statistical mapping, there are up to now only two tests used to assess the regional significance in functional images. One is based on the magnitude of the foci and tends to detect high intensity signals, while the second is based on the spatial extent of regions defined by a simple thresholding of the statistical map, a test that is more sensitive to extended signals. The aim of this paper is to combine the two tests into a single test that is more sensitive to a wider range of signals. This combined test is based on an analytical approximation of the distribution of these two parameters (size and height) and is applied in the context of statistical maps. The risk of error in noise-only 2D or 3D volumes is assessed under a wide range of experimental conditions obtained by varying both the resolution of the map and the threshold at which clusters are defined. In addition, we have investigated this new test on simulated signals, and applied it to an experimental PET dataset. The experimental risk of error is close to the predicted one, and the overall sensitivity increases when analyzing a volume containing different types of signals.},

abstract = {We define a general statistical framework for multiple hypothesis testing and show that the correct null distribution for the test statistics is obtained by projecting the true distribution of the test statistics onto the space of mean zero distributions. For common choices of test statistics (based on an asymptotically linear parameter es- timator), this distribution is asymptotically multivariate normal with mean zero and the covariance of the vector influence curve for the parameter estimator. This test statistic null distribution can be estimated by applying the non-parametric or parametric bootstrap to correctly centered test statistics. We prove that this boot- strap estimated null distribution provides asymptotic control of most type I error rates. We show that obtaining a test statistic null distribution from a data null distribution, e.g. projecting the data generating distribution onto the space of all distributions satisfying the complete null), only provides the correct test statistic null distribution if the covariance of the vector influence curve is the same under the data null distribution as under the true data distribution. This condition is a weak version of the subset pivotality condition. We show that our multiple testing methodology controlling type I error is equivalent to constructing an error-specific confidence region for the true parameter and checking if it contains the hypothe- sized value. We also study the two sample problem and show that the permutation distribution produces an asymptotically correct null distribution if (i) the sample sizes are equal or (ii) the populations have the same covariance structure. We in- clude a discussion of the application of multiple testing to gene expression data, where the dimension typically far exceeds the sample size. An analysis of a cancer gene expression data set illustrates the methodology.},

abstract = {Resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) is widely used to investigate brain networks that exhibit correlated fluctuations. While fcMRI does not provide direct measurement of anatomic connectivity, accumulating evidence suggests it is sufficiently constrained by anatomy to allow the architecture of distinct brain systems to be characterized. fcMRI is particularly useful for characterizing large-scale systems that span distributed areas (e.g., polysynaptic cortical pathways, cerebro-cerebellar circuits, cortical-thalamic circuits) and has complementary strengths when contrasted with the other major tool available for human connectomics-high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). We review what is known about fcMRI and then explore fcMRI data reliability, effects of preprocessing, analysis procedures, and effects of different acquisition parameters across six studies (n = 98) to provide recommendations for optimization. Run length (2-12 min), run structure (1 12-min run or 2 6-min runs), temporal resolution (2.5 or 5.0 s), spatial resolution (2 or 3 mm), and the task (fixation, eyes closed rest, eyes open rest, continuous word-classification) were varied. Results revealed moderate to high test-retest reliability. Run structure, temporal resolution, and spatial resolution minimally influenced fcMRI results while fixation and eyes open rest yielded stronger correlations as contrasted to other task conditions. Commonly used preprocessing steps involving regression of nuisance signals minimized nonspecific (noise) correlations including those associated with respiration. The most surprising finding was that estimates of correlation strengths stabilized with acquisition times as brief as 5 min. The brevity and robustness of fcMRI positions it as a powerful tool for large-scale explorations of genetic influences on brain architecture. We conclude by discussing the strengths and limitations of fcMRI and how it can be combined with HARDI techniques to support the emerging field of human connectomics.},

abstract = {The standard analysis approach in neuroimaging genetics studies is the mass-univariate linear modeling (MULM) approach. From a statistical view, however, this approach is disadvantageous, as it is computationally intensive, cannot account for complex multivariate relationships, and has to be corrected for multiple testing. In contrast, multivariate methods offer the opportunity to include combined information from multiple variants to discover meaningful associations between genetic and brain imaging data. We assessed three multivariate techniques, partial least squares correlation (PLSC), sparse canonical correlation analysis (sparse CCA) and Bayesian inter-battery factor analysis (Bayesian IBFA), with respect to their ability to detect multivariate genotype-phenotype associations. Our goal was to systematically compare these three approaches with respect to their performance and to assess their suitability for high-dimensional and multi-collinearly dependent data as is the case in neuroimaging genetics studies. In a series of simulations using both linearly independent and multi-collinear data, we show that sparse CCA and PLSC are suitable even for very high-dimensional collinear imaging data sets. Among those two, the predictive power was higher for sparse CCA when voxel numbers were below 400 times sample size and candidate SNPs were considered. Accordingly, we recommend Sparse CCA for candidate phenotype, candidate SNP studies. When voxel numbers exceeded 500 times sample size, the predictive power was the highest for PLSC. Therefore, PLSC can be considered a promising technique for multivariate modeling of high-dimensional brain-SNP-associations. In contrast, Bayesian IBFA cannot be recommended, since additional post-processing steps were necessary to detect causal relations. To verify the applicability of sparse CCA and PLSC, we applied them to an experimental imaging genetics data set provided for us. Most importantly, application of both methods replicated the findings of this data set.},

abstract = {The field of functional neuroimaging (FNI) methodology has developed into a mature but evolving area of knowledge and its applications have been extensive. A general problem in the analysis of FNI data is finding a signal embedded in noise. This is sometimes called signal detection. Signal detection theory focuses in general on issues relating to the optimization of conditions for separating the signal from noise. When methods from probability theory and mathematical statistics are directly applied in this procedure it is also called statistical inference. In this paper we briefly discuss some aspects of signal detection theory relevant to FNI and, in addition, some common approaches to statistical inference used in FNI. Low-pass filtering in relation to functional-anatomical variability and some effects of filtering on signal detection of interest to FNI are discussed. Also, some general aspects of hypothesis testing and statistical inference are discussed. This includes the need for characterizing the signal in data when the null hypothesis is rejected, the problem of multiple comparisons that is central to FNI data analysis, omnibus tests and some issues related to statistical power in the context of FNI. In turn, random field, scale space, non-parametric and Monte Carlo approaches are reviewed, representing the most common approaches to statistical inference used in FNI. Complementary to these issues an overview and discussion of non-inferential descriptive methods, common statistical models and the problem of model selection is given in a companion paper. In general, model selection is an important prelude to subsequent statistical inference. The emphasis in both papers is on the assumptions and inherent limitations of the methods presented. Most of the methods described here generally serve their purposes well when the inherent assumptions and limitations are taken into account. Significant differences in results between different methods are most apparent in extreme parameter ranges, for example at low effective degrees of freedom or at small spatial autocorrelation. In such situations or in situations when assumptions and approximations are seriously violated it is of central importance to choose the most suitable method in order to obtain valid results.},

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies often involve the acquisition of data from multiple sessions and/or multiple subjects. A hierarchical approach can be taken to modelling such data with a general linear model (GLM) at each level of the hierarchy introducing different random effects variance components. Inferring on these models is nontrivial with frequentist solutions being unavailable. A solution is to use a Bayesian framework. One important ingredient in this is the choice of prior on the variance components and top-level regression parameters. Due to the typically small numbers of sessions or subjects in neuroimaging, the choice of prior is critical. To alleviate this problem, we introduce to neuroimage modelling the approach of reference priors, which drives the choice of prior such that it is noninformative in an information-theoretic sense. We propose two inference techniques at the top level for multilevel hierarchies (a fast approach and a slower more accurate approach). We also demonstrate that we can infer on the top level of multilevel hierarchies by inferring on the levels of the hierarchy separately and passing summary statistics of a noncentral multivariate t distribution between them. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Functional neuroimaging (FNI) provides experimental access to the intact living brain making it possible to study higher cognitive functions in humans. In this review and in a companion paper in this issue, we discuss some common methods used to analyse FNI data. The emphasis in both papers is on assumptions and limitations of the methods reviewed. There are several methods available to analyse FNI data indicating that none is optimal for all purposes. In order to make optimal use of the methods available it is important to know the limits of applicability. For the interpretation of FNI results it is also important to take into account the assumptions, approximations and inherent limitations of the methods used. This paper gives a brief overview over some non-inferential descriptive methods and common statistical models used in FNI. Issues relating to the complex problem of model selection are discussed. In general, proper model selection is a necessary prerequisite for the validity of the subsequent statistical inference. The non-inferential section describes methods that, combined with inspection of parameter estimates and other simple measures, can aid in the process of model selection and verification of assumptions. The section on statistical models covers approaches to global normalization and some aspects of univariate, multivariate, and Bayesian models. Finally, approaches to functional connectivity and effective connectivity are discussed. In the companion paper we review issues related to signal detection and statistical inference.},

abstract = {At its simplest, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) involves a voxel-wise comparison of the local concentration of gray matter between two groups of subjects. The procedure is relatively straightforward and involves spatially normalizing high-resolution images from all the subjects in the study into the same stereotactic space. This is followed by segmenting the gray matter from the spatially normalized images and smoothing the gray-matter segments. Voxel-wise parametric statistical tests which compare the smoothed gray-matter images from the two groups are performed. Corrections for multiple comparisons are made using the theory of Gaussian random fields. This paper describes the steps involved in VBM, with particular emphasis on segmenting gray matter from MR images with nonuniformity artifact. We provide evaluations of the assumptions that underpin the method, including the accuracy of the segmentation and the assumptions made about the statistical distribution of the data.},

abstract = {A method is given for determining the time course and spatial extent of consistently and transiently task-related activations from other physiological and artifactual components that contribute to functional MRI (fMRI) recordings. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to analyze two fMRI data sets from a subject performing 6-min trials composed of alternating 40-sec Stroop color-naming and control task blocks. Each component consisted of a fixed three-dimensional spatial distribution of brain voxel values (a “map”) and an associated time course of activation. For each trial, the algorithm detected, without a priori knowledge of their spatial or temporal structure, one consistently task-related component activated during each Stroop task block, plus several transiently task-related components activated at the onset of one or two of the Stroop task blocks only. Activation patterns occurring during only part of the fMRI trial are not observed with other techniques, because their time courses cannot easily be known in advance. Other ICA components were related to physiological pulsations, head movements, or machine noise. By using higher-order statistics to specify stricter criteria for spatial independence between component maps, ICA produced improved estimates of the temporal and spatial extent of task-related activation in our data compared with principal component analysis (PCA). ICA appears to be a promising tool for exploratory analysis of fMRI data, particularly when the time courses of activation are not known in advance.},

The random field (RF) theory has been widely used in implementation of such tests, however the behavior of such tests is not well understood, especially when the RF assumptions are in doubt. In this paper, we carried out a simulation study of cluster size tests under varying smoothness, thresholds, and degrees of freedom, comparing RF performance to that of the permutation test, which is known to be exact. For Gaussian images, we find that the RF methods are generally conservative, especially for low smoothness and low threshold. For t images, the RF tests are found to be conservative at lower thresholds and do not perform well unless the threshold is high and images are sufficiently smooth. The permutation test performs well for any settings though the discreteness in cluster size must be accounted for. We make specific recommendations on when permutation tests are to be preferred to RF tests. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The temporal characteristics of the BOLD response in sensorimotor and auditory cortices were measured in subjects performing finger tapping while listening to metronome pacing tones. A repeated trial paradigm was used with stimulus durations of 167 ms to 16 s and intertrial times of 30 s. Both cortical systems were found to be nonlinear in that the response to a long stimulus could not be predicted by convolving the 1-s response with a rectangular function. In the short-time regime, the amplitude of the response varied only slowly with stimulus duration. It was found that this character was predicted with a modification to Buxton's balloon model. Wiener deconvolution was used to deblur the response to concatenated short episodes of finger tapping at different temporal separations and at rates from 1 to 4 Hz. While the measured response curves were distorted by overlap between the individual episodes, the deconvolved response at each rate was found to agree well with separate scans at each of the individual rates. Thus, although the impulse response cannot predict the response to fully overlapping stimuli, linear deconvolution is effective when the stimuli are separated by at least 4 s. The deconvolution filter must be measured for each subject using a short-stimulus paradigm. It is concluded that deconvolution may be effective in diminishing the hemodynamically imposed temporal blurring and may have potential applications in quantitating responses in eventrelated fMRI.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging has evolved into a widely used method to investigate the functional neuroanatomy, brain-behaviour relationships, and pathophysiology of brain disorders, yielding a literature of more than 30,000 papers. With such an explosion of data, it is increasingly difficult to sift through the literature and distinguish spurious from replicable findings. Furthermore, due to the large number of studies, it is challenging to keep track of the wealth of findings. A variety of meta-analytical methods (coordinate-based and image-based) have been developed to help summarise and integrate the vast amount of data arising from neuroimaging studies. However, the field lacks specific guidelines for the conduct of such meta-analyses. Based on our combined experience, we propose best-practice recommendations that researchers from multiple disciplines may find helpful. In addition, we provide specific guidelines and a checklist that will hopefully improve the transparency, traceability, replicability and reporting of meta-analytical results of neuroimaging data.},

abstract = {The last 15 years have witnessed a steady increase in the number of resting-state functional neuroimaging studies. The connectivity patterns of multiple functional, distributed, large-scale networks of brain dynamics have been recognised for their potential as useful tools in the domain of systems and other neurosciences. The application of functional connectivity methods to areas such as cognitive psychology, clinical diagnosis and treatment progression has yielded promising preliminary results, but is yet to be fully realised. This is due, in part, to an array of methodological and interpretative issues that remain to be resolved. We here present a review of the methods most commonly applied in this rapidly advancing field, such as seed-based correlation analysis and independent component analysis, along with examples of their use at the individual subject and group analysis levels and a discussion of practical and theoretical issues arising from this data 'explosion'. We describe the similarities and differences across these varied statistical approaches to processing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging signals, and conclude that further technical optimisation and experimental refinement is required in order to fully delineate and characterise the gross complexity of the human neural functional architecture.},

abstract = {This paper is about detecting activations in statistical parametric maps and considers the relative sensitivity of a nested hierarchy of tests that we have framed in terms of the level of inference (voxel level, cluster level, and set level). These tests are based on the probability of obtaining c, or more, clusters with k, or more, voxels, above a threshold u. This probability has a reasonably simple form and is derived using distributional approximations from the theory of Gaussian fields. The most important contribution of this work is the notion of set-level inference. Set-level inference refers to the statistical inference that the number of clusters comprising an observed activation profile is highly unlikely to have occurred by chance. This inference pertains to the set of activations reaching criteria and represents a new way of assigning P values to distributed effects. Cluster-level inferences are a special case of set-level inferences, which obtain when the number of clusters c = 1. Similarly voxel-level inferences are special cases of cluster-level inferences that result when the cluster can be very small (i.e., k = 0). Using a theoretical power analysis of distributed activations, we observed that set-level inferences are generally more powerful than cluster-level inferences and that cluster-level inferences are generally more powerful than voxel-level inferences. The price paid for this increased sensitivity is reduced localizing power: Voxel-level tests permit individual voxels to be identified as significant, whereas cluster-and set-level inferences only allow clusters or sets of clusters to be so identified. For all levels of inference the spatial size of the underlying signal f (relative to resolution) determines the most powerful thresholds to adopt. For set-level inferences if f is large (e.g., fMRI) then the optimum extent threshold should be greater than the expected number of voxels for each cluster. If f is small (e.g., PET) the extent threshold should be small. We envisage that set-level inferences will find a role in making statistical inferences about distributed activations, particularly in fMRI.},

Over 100 years our field qualitatively described and invasively manipulated single or few organisms to gain anatomical, physiological, and pharmacological insights. In the last 10 years neuroscience spawned quantitative datasets of unprecedented breadth (e.g., microanatomy, synaptic connections, and optogenetic brain-behavior assays) and size (e.g., cognition, brain imaging, and genetics). While growing data availability and information granularity have been amply discussed, we direct attention to a less explored question: How will the unprecedented data richness shape data analysis practices? Statistical reasoning is becoming more important to distill neurobiological knowledge from healthy and pathological brain measurements. We argue that large-scale data analysis will use more statistical models that are non-parametric, generative, and mixing frequentist and Bayesian aspects, while supplementing classical hypothesis testing with out-of-sample predictions.},

abstract = {Finding objective and effective thresholds for voxelwise statistics derived from neuroimaging data has been a long-standing problem. With at least one test performed for every voxel in an image, some correction of the thresholds is needed to control the error rates, but standard procedures for multiple hypothesis testing (e.g., Bonferroni) tend to not be sensitive enough to be useful in this context. This paper introduces to the neuroscience literature statistical procedures for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Recent theoretical work in statistics suggests that FDR-controlling procedures will be effective for the analysis of neuroimaging data. These procedures operate simultaneously on all voxelwise test statistics to determine which tests should be considered statistically significant. The innovation of the procedures is that they control the expected proportion of the rejected hypotheses that are falsely rejected. We demonstrate this approach using both simulations and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from two simple experiments.},

First, we evaluate the feasibility of two techniques for correcting for multiple comparisons: the single threshold test and a procedure that controls the false discovery rate (FDR). To test these techniques, foci from four different topics within the literature were analyzed: overt speech in stuttering subjects, the color-word Stroop task, picture-naming tasks, and painful stimulation. In addition, the performance of each thresholding method was tested on randomly generated foci. We found that the FDR method more effectively controls the rate of false positives in meta-analyses of small or large numbers of foci. Second, we propose a technique for making statistical comparisons of ALE meta-analyses and investigate its efficacy on different groups of foci divided by task or response type and random groups of similarly obtained foci. We then give an example of how comparisons of this sort may lead to advanced designs in future meta-analytic research.},

@article{Friston1990,
abstract = {In order to localize cerebral cognitive or sensorimotor function, activation paradigms are being used in conjunction with PET measures of cerebral activity (e.g., rCBF). The changes in local cerebral activity have two components: a global, region independent change and a local or regional change. As the first step in localizing the regional effects of an activation, global variance must be removed by a normalization procedure. A simple normalization procedure is division of regional values by the whole brain mean. This requires the dependence of local activity on global activity to be one of simple proportionality. This is shown not to be the case. Furthermore, a systematic deviation from a proportional relationship across brain regions is demonstrated. Consequently, any normalization must be approached on a pixel-by-pixel basis by measuring the change in local activity and change in global activity. The changes associated with an activation can be partitioned into global and local effects according to two models: one assumes that the increase in local activity depends on global values and the other assumes independence. It is shown that the increase in activity due to a cognitive activation is independent of global activity. This independence of the (activation) condition effect and the confounding linear effect of global activity on observed local activity meet the requirements for an analysis of covariance, with the "nuisance" variable as global activity and the activation condition as the categorical independent variable. These conclusions are based on analysis of data from 24 scans: six conditions over four normal subjects using a verbal fluency paradigm.},

abstract = {Mounting evidence over the last few years suggest that published neuroscience research suffer from low power, and especially for published fMRI experiments. Not only does low power decrease the chance of detecting a true effect, it also reduces the chance that a statistically significant result indicates a true effect (Ioannidis, 2005). Put another way, findings with the least power will be the least reproducible, and thus a (prospective) power analysis is a critical component of any paper. In this work we present a simple way to characterize the spatial signal in a fMRI study with just two parameters, and a direct way to estimate these two parameters based on an existing study. Specifically, using just (1) the proportion of the brain activated and (2) the average effect size in activated brain regions, we can produce closed form power calculations for given sample size, brain volume and smoothness. This procedure allows one to minimize the cost of an fMRI experiment, while preserving a predefined statistical power. The method is evaluated and illustrated using simulations and real neuroimaging data from the Human Connectome Project. The procedures presented in this paper are made publicly available in an online web-based toolbox available at www.neuropowertools.org.},

In order to avoid overfitting, we employ objective estimation of the amount of Gaussian noise through Bayesian analysis of the true dimensionality of the data, i.e., the number of activation and non-Gaussian noise sources. This enables us to carry out probabilistic modeling and achieves an asymptoti- cally unique decomposition of the data. It reduces problems of interpretation, as each final independent component is now much more likely to be due to only one physical or physiological process. We also describe other improvements to standard ICA, such as temporal prewhitening and variance normalization of timeseries, the latter being particularly useful in the context of dimensionality reduction when weak activation is present. We discuss the use of prior information about the spatiotemporal nature of the source processes, and an alternative-hypothesis testing approach for inference, using Gaussian mixture models. The performance of our approach is illustrated and evaluated on real and artificial FMRI data, and compared to the spatio-temporal accuracy of results obtained from classical ICA and GLM analyses.},

abstract = {Temporal autocorrelation, spatial coherency, and their effects on voxel-wise parametric statistics were examined in BOLD fMRI null-hypothesis, or “noise,” datasets. Seventeen normal, young subjects were scanned using BOLD fMRI while not performing any time-locked experimental behavior. Temporal autocorrelation in these datasets was described well by a 1/frequency relationship. Voxel-wise statistical analysis of these noise datasets which assumed independence (i.e., ignored temporal autocorrelation) rejected the null hypothesis at a higher rate than specified by the nominal $\alpha$. Temporal smoothing in conjunction with the use of a modified general linear model (Worsley and Friston, 1995,NeuroImage2: 173–182) brought the false-positive rate closer to the nominal $\alpha$. It was also found that the noise fMRI datasets contain spatially coherent time signals. This observed spatial coherence could not be fully explained by a continuously differentiable spatial autocovariance function and was much greater for lower temporal frequencies. Its presence made voxel-wise test statistics in a given noise dataset dependent, and thus shifted their distributions to the right or left of 0. Inclusion of a “global signal” covariate in the general linear model reduced this dependence and consequently stabilized (i.e., reduced the variance of) dataset false-positive rates.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging research has predominantly drawn conclusions based on classical statistics, including null-hypothesis testing, t-tests, and ANOVA. Throughout recent years, statistical learning methods enjoy increasing popularity, including cross-validation, pattern classification, and sparsity-inducing regression. These two methodological families used for neuroimaging data analysis can be viewed as two extremes of a continuum. Yet, they originated from different historical contexts, build on different theories, rest on different assumptions, evaluate different outcome metrics, and permit different conclusions. This paper portrays commonalities and differences between classical statistics and statistical learning with their relation to neuroimaging research. The conceptual implications are illustrated in three common analysis scenarios. It is thus tried to resolve possible confusion between classical hypothesis testing and data-guided model estimation by discussing their ramifications for the neuroimaging access to neurobiology.},

@article{Smith2006,
abstract = {There has been much recent interest in using magnetic resonance diffusion imaging to provide information about anatomical connectivity in the brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white matter tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from diffusion data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how strongly directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical analyses, in order to localise brain changes related to development, degeneration and disease. However, optimal analysis is compromised by the use of standard registration algorithms; there has not to date been a satisfactory solution to the question of how to align FA images from multiple subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be drawn from the subsequent voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been resolved. In this paper, we present a new method that aims to solve these issues via (a) carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by (b) projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the "mean FA skeleton"). We refer to this new approach as Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). TBSS aims to improve the sensitivity, objectivity and interpretability of analysis of multi-subject diffusion imaging studies. We describe TBSS in detail and present example TBSS results from several diffusion imaging studies.},

abstract = {The validity of inference based on the General Linear Model (GLM) for the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series has recently been questioned. Bootstrap procedures that partially avoid modeling assumptions may offer a welcome solution. We empirically compare two voxelwise GLM-based bootstrap approaches: a semi-parametric approach, relying solely on a model for the expected signal; and a fully parametric bootstrap approach, requiring an additional parameterization of the temporal structure. While the fully parametric approach assumes independent whitened residuals, the semi-parametric approach relies on independent blocks of residuals. The evaluation is based on inferential properties and the potential to reproduce important data characteristics. Different noise structures and data-generating mechanisms for the signal are simulated. When the model for the noise and expected signal is correct, we find that the fully parametric approach works well, with respect to both inference and reproduction of data characteristics. However, in the presence of misspecification, the fully parametric approach can be improved with additional blocking. The semi-parametric approach performs worse than the (fully) parametric approach with respect to inference but achieves comparable results as the parametric approach with additional blocking with respect to image reproducibility. We demonstrate that when the expected signal is incorrect GLM-based bootstrapping can overcome the poor performance of classical (non-bootstrap) parametric inference. We illustrate both approaches on a study exploring the neural representation of object representation in the visual pathway.},

abstract = {A neuroscientific experiment typically generates a large amount of data, of which only a small fraction is analyzed in detail and presented in a publication. However, selection among noisy measurements can render circular an otherwise appropriate analysis and invalidate results. Here we argue that systems neuroscience needs to adjust some widespread practices to avoid the circularity that can arise from selection. In particular, 'double dipping', the use of the same dataset for selection and selective analysis, will give distorted descriptive statistics and invalid statistical inference whenever the results statistics are not inherently independent of the selection criteria under the null hypothesis. To demonstrate the problem, we apply widely used analyses to noise data known to not contain the experimental effects in question. Spurious effects can appear in the context of both univariate activation analysis and multivariate pattern-information analysis. We suggest a policy for avoiding circularity.},

abstract = {In fMRI research, one often aims to examine activation in specific functional regions of interest (fROIs). Current statistical methods tend to localize fROIs inconsistently, focusing on avoiding detection of false activation. Not missing true activation is however equally important in this context. In this study, we explored the potential of an alternative-based thresholding (ABT) procedure, where evidence against the null hypothesis of no effect and evidence against a prespecified alternative hypothesis is measured to control both false positives and false negatives directly. The procedure was validated in the context of localizer tasks on simulated brain images and using a real data set of 100 runs per subject. Voxels categorized as active with ABT can be confidently included in the definition of the fROI, while inactive voxels can be confidently excluded. Additionally, the ABT method complements classic null hypothesis significance testing with valuable information by making a distinction between voxels that show evidence against both the null and alternative and voxels for which the alternative hypothesis cannot be rejected despite lack of evidence against the null.},

abstract = {The analysis of brain imaging data has recently focused on the examination of the covariances of activity among neural regions during different behaviors. We present some of the theoretical and technical issues surrounding one of these covariance-based methods: structural equation modeling. In structural equation modeling, connections between brain areas are based on known neuroanatomy, and the interregional covariances of activity are used to calculate path coefficients representing the magnitude of the influence of each directional path. The logic behind the use of structural equation modeling stems from the suggestion that brain function is the result of changes in the covariances of activity among neural elements. The technical foundations for neural structural equation models are presented, emphasizing the ability to make inferential comparisons to evaluate the experimental changes in path coefficients. Simulated data sets were used to test the effects of omitted regions and omitted connections. The results suggested that structural modeling algorithms can give hints as to possible external influences and missing paths, but that the final decision as to model modifications requires the guidance of the researcher. The utility of anatomically based models to distinguish between the direct effect of one region on another, and indirect effects of darkness or patterned light on the metabolic activity in the rat visual system. The anatomical framework for the structural equation models revealed that the total impact of ascending thalamocortical influences was modified by corticocortical interactions. Extensions of structural equation modeling to human brain imaging experiments are presented. We conclude by suggesting that neural covariances may be a more accurate way to examine the dynamic functional organization of the central nervous system.},

In the second section, the biophysical mechanisms that alter the apparent transverse relaxation time, T(2*), in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) studies and the creation of BOLD activation maps are discussed. The physiological complexity of the BOLD signal is emphasized. In the third section, arterial spin labeling (ASL) measures of cerebral blood flow are presented. Arterial spin labeling inverts or saturates the magnetization of flowing spins to measure the rate of delivery of blood to capillaries. In the fourth section, calibrated fMRI, which uses BOLD and ASL to infer alterations of oxygen utilization during behavioral activation, is reviewed.

@article{Ioannidis2008,
abstract = {Newly discovered true (non-null) associations often have inflated effects compared with the true effect sizes. I discuss here the main reasons for this inflation. First, theoretical considerations prove that when true discovery is claimed based on crossing a threshold of statistical significance and the discovery study is underpowered, the observed effects are expected to be inflated. This has been demonstrated in various fields ranging from early stopped clinical trials to genome-wide associations. Second, flexible analyses coupled with selective reporting may inflate the published discovered effects. The vibration ratio (the ratio of the largest vs. smallest effect on the same association approached with different analytic choices) can be very large. Third, effects may be inflated at the stage of interpretation due to diverse conflicts of interest. Discovered effects are not always inflated, and under some circumstances may be deflated-for example, in the setting of late discovery of associations in sequentially accumulated overpowered evidence, in some types of misclassification from measurement error, and in conflicts causing reverse biases. Finally, I discuss potential approaches to this problem. These include being cautious about newly discovered effect sizes, considering some rational down-adjustment, using analytical methods that correct for the anticipated inflation, ignoring the magnitude of the effect (if not necessary), conducting large studies in the discovery phase, using strict protocols for analyses, pursuing complete and transparent reporting of all results, placing emphasis on replication, and being fair with interpretation of results.},

The familywise error rate, the chance of any false positives is the standard measure of Type I errors in multiple testing. In this paper we review and evaluate three approaches to thresholding images of test statistics: Bonferroni, random field and the permutation test. Owing to recent developments, improved Bonferroni procedures, such as Hochberg's methods, are now applicable to dependent data. Continuous random field methods use the smoothness of the image to adapt to the severity of the multiple testing problem. Also, increased computing power has made both permutation and bootstrap methods applicable to functional neuroimaging. We evaluate these approaches on t images using simulations and a collection of real datasets. We find that Bonferroni-related tests offer little improvement over Bonferroni, while the permutation method offers substantial improvement over the random field method for low smoothness and low degrees of freedom. We also show the limitations of trying to find an equivalent number of independent tests for an image of correlated test statistics.},

abstract = {Functional imaging studies examining the neural correlates of risk have mainly relied on paradigms involving exposure to simple chance gambles and an economic definition of risk as variance in the probability distribution over possible outcomes. However, there is little evidence that choices made during gambling tasks predict naturalistic risk-taking behaviors such as drug use, extreme sports, or even equity investing. To better understand the neural basis of naturalistic risk-taking, we scanned participants using fMRI while they completed the Balloon Analog Risk Task, an experimental measure that includes an active decision/choice component and that has been found to correlate with a number of naturalistic risk-taking behaviors. In the task, as in many naturalistic settings, escalating risk-taking occurs under uncertainty and might be experienced either as the accumulation of greater potential rewards, or as exposure to increasing possible losses (and decreasing expected value). We found that areas previously linked to risk and risk-taking (bilateral anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) were activated as participants continued to inflate balloons. Interestingly, we found that ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity decreased as participants further expanded balloons. In light of previous findings implicating the vmPFC in value calculation, this result suggests that escalating risk-taking in the task might be perceived as exposure to increasing possible losses (and decreasing expected value) rather than the increasing potential total reward relative to the starting point of the trial. A better understanding of how neural activity changes with risk-taking behavior in the task offers insight into the potential neural mechanisms driving naturalistic risk-taking.},

However, the effect of publication bias in these fields has not been previously addressed or accounted for in the developed meta-analytic methods. In this article, we examine publication bias in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for tasks involving working memory in the frontal lobes (Brodmann Areas 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 37, 45, 46, and 47). Seventy-four studies were selected from the literature and the effect of publication bias was examined using a number of regression-based techniques. Pearson's r correlation coefficient and Cohen's d effect size estimates were computed for the activation in each study and compared to the study sample size using Egger's regression, Macaskill's regression, and the 'Trim and Fill' method. Evidence for publication bias was identified in this body of literature (p {\textless} 0.01 for each test), generally, though was neither task- nor sub-region-dependent. While we focused our analysis on this subgroup of brain mapping studies, we believe our findings generalize to the brain imaging literature as a whole and databases seeking to curate their collective results. While neuroimaging databases of summary effects are of enormous value to the community, the potential publication bias should be considered when performing meta-analyses based on database contents.},

Recent research indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) have an important role in regulating stem cell self-renewal and differentiation by repressing the translation of selected mRNAs in stem cells and differentiating daughter cells. Such a role has been shown in embryonic stem cells, germline stem cells and various somatic tissue stem cells. These findings reveal a new dimension of gene regulation in controlling stem cell fate and behaviour.},

@article{Anderson1999,
abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of several structure-seeking multivariate statistical techniques, exploratory as well as inferential, that have been proposed recently for the characterization and detection of activation in both PET and fMRI time series data. In particular, PCA is data driven and does not assume that the neural or hemodynamic response reaches some steady state, nor does it involve correlation with any pre-defined or exogenous experimental design template. In this paper, we present a generalized linear systems framework for PCA based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) model for representation of spatio-temporal fMRI data sets. Statistical inference procedures for PCA, including point and interval estimation will be introduced without the constraint of explicit hypotheses about specific task-dependent effects. The principal eigenvectors capture both the spatial and temporal aspects of fMRI data in a progressive fashion; they are inherently matched to unique and uncorrelated features and are ranked in order of the amount of variance explained. PCA also acts as a variation reduction technique, relegating most of the random noise to the trailing components while collecting systematic structure into the leading ones. Features summarizing variability may not directly be those that are the most useful. Further analysis is facilitated through linear subspace methods involving PC rotation and strategies of projection pursuit utilizing a reduced, lower-dimensional natural basis representation that retains most of the information. These properties will be illustrated in the setting of dynamic time-series response data from fMRI experiments involving pharmacological stimulation of the dopaminergic nigro-striatal system in primates.},

@article{Taylor2007,
abstract = {Brain mapping data have been modeled as Gaussian random fields, and local increases in mean are detected by local maxima of a random field of test statistics derived from these data. Accurate p values for local maxima are readily available for isotropic data based on the expected Euler characteristic of the excursion set of the test statistic random field. In this article we give a simple method for dealing with nonisotropic data. Our approach has connections to the model of Sampson and Guttorp for nonisotropy in which there exists an unknown mapping of the support of the data to a space in which the random fields are isotropic. Heuristic justification for our approach comes from the Nash embedding theorem. Formally, we show that our method gives consistent unbiased estimators for the true p values based on new results of Taylor and Adler for random fields on manifolds, which replace the Euclidean metric by the variogram. The results are used to detect gender differences in the cortical thickness of the brain and to detect regions of the brain involved in sentence comprehension measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging.},
