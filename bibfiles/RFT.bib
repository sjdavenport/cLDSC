abstract = {Spatial analysis provides a powerful method to test epidemiologic hypotheses about patterns of disease occurrence. Available techniques can be classified based on the type of data which they utilize, generally areas or points, and the primary question of interest. Three issues relevant to epidemiology are: whether a disease is clustered; whether two diseases or a disease and potential risk factor have the same distribution; and if there are specific definable relationships between the values of the same variable at different locations. Join count statistics, which relate actual and expected number of joins between areas with dissimilar values, and second order analysis, which compares the actual and expected distances between all points weighted by their values, give estimates of the magnitude and statistical significance of clustering in patterns. To test for codistribution between areal patterns, the kappa statistic evaluates the degree of pattern overlap corrected for chance. Tjosteim's statistic measures the correlation, corrected for point locations, of the ranked values. Spatial autocorrelation analysis can be used to test for specific network and distance associations between values, for the scale of a pattern, for defined complex spatial relationships or to remove spatial effects from more traditional regression analysis of other risk factors. Epidemiologists have uncovered spatial associations between diseases and risk factors using traditional methods. However, more widespread application of spatial analyses to objectively quantify the magnitude and significance of hypothesized geographical associations could offer new insights into disease questions. {\textcopyright} 1991 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

@article{Hainaut2018,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Most of the models leading to an analytical expression for option prices are based on the assumption that underlying asset returns evolve according to a Brownian motion with drift. For some asset classes like commodities, a Brownian model does not fit empirical covariance and autocorrelation structures. This failure to replicate the covariance introduces a bias in the valuation of calendar spread exchange options. As the payoff of these options depends on two asset values at different times, particular care must be taken for the modeling of covariance and autocorrelation. This article proposes a simple alternative model for asset prices with sub-exponential, exponential and hyper-exponential autocovariance structures. In the proposed approach, price processes are seen as conditional Gaussian fields indexed by the time. In general, this process is not a semi-martingale, and therefore, we cannot rely on stochastic differential calculus to evaluate options. However, option prices are still calculable by the technique of the change of numeraire. A numerical illustration confirms the important influence of the covariance structure in the valuation of calendar spread exchange options for Brent against WTI crude oil and for gold against silver.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

As an application of the STEM algorithm for peak detection developed in $\backslash$citet{\{}Schwartzman:2011{\}} and $\backslash$citet{\{}CS:2014b{\}}, the method detects change points as significant local maxima and minima after smoothing and differentiating the observed sequence. The algorithm, combined with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for thresholding p-values, provides asymptotic strong control of the False Discovery Rate (FDR) and power consistency, as the length of the sequence and the size of the jumps get large. Simulations show that FDR levels are maintained in non-asymptotic conditions and guide the choice of smoothing bandwidth with respect to the desired location tolerance. The methods are illustrated in genomic array-CGH data.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging produces data that are continuous in one or more dimensions. This calls for an inference framework that can handle data that approximate functions of space, for example, anatomical images, time-frequency maps and distributed source reconstructions of electromagnetic recordings over time. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is the standard framework for whole-brain inference in neuroimaging: SPM uses random field theory to furnish p-values that are adjusted to control family-wise error or false discovery rates, when making topological inferences over large volumes of space. Random field theory regards data as realizations of a continuous process in one or more dimensions. This contrasts with classical approaches like the Bonferroni correction, which consider images as collections of discrete samples with no continuity properties (i.e., the probabilistic behavior at one point in the image does not depend on other points). Here, we illustrate how random field theory can be applied to data that vary as a function of time, space or frequency. We emphasize how topological inference of this sort is invariant to the geometry of the manifolds on which data are sampled. This is particularly useful in electromagnetic studies that often deal with very smooth data on scalp or cortical meshes. This application illustrates the versatility and simplicity of random field theory and the seminal contributions of Keith J. Worsley (1951-2009), a key architect of topological inference.},

abstract = {Images from positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are often modelled as stationary Gaussian random fields, and a general linear model is used to test for the effect of explanatory varaibles on a set of such images (Friston et al., 1994; Worsley and Friston, 1995). Thompson et al. (1996) have modelled displacements of brain surfaces as a multivariate Gaussian random field. In order to test for significant local maxima in such fields using the theory of Adler (1981) and its recent refinements (Worsley, 1994, 1995a, 1995b; Siegmund andWorsley, 1995), we need to estimate the roughness of such fields. This is defined as the variance matrix of the derivative of the random field in each dimension. Some methods have been given by Worlsey et al. (1992) for the special case of stationary variance of the random field, and where the random field is sampled on a uniform lattice. In this note we generalise to the case of multivariate Gaussian data with unknown non-stationary variance matrix, and non-lattice sampling. This latter is particularly important for studying the displacement of brain surfaces, which will be the subject of a future publication.},

abstract = {A simple spatial-correlation model is presented for repeated measures data. Correlation between observations on the same subject is assumed to decay as a linear function of the squared distance separating the regions in three-dimensional space where the observations are made. This quadratic decay (QD) model has many attractive theoretical properties. The covariance structure of the “normalized” data, formed by subtracting the subject average, is the same as that generated by random linear trends plus centered white noise, which leads to a simple method for simulating the original data. It also implies that the first three principal components of the normalized observations are the spatial coordinates of the regions. Thus principal components analysis can be used as an exploratory tool to verify the QD model, provided the white noise component is small. Certain simple predictions can be made, such as the fact that the variances of the normalized observations increase linearly with the squared distance from the centroid of the regions, even though the original observations are assumed to have equal variance. This implies that it is harder to detect abnormal regional measurements in the outlying regions using normalized observations. Assuming multivariate normality, generalized least squares can be used to find maximum likelihood estimates of the QD model; calculations can be reduced using an expression for the inverse of the covariance matrix that only involves the inverse of a 3 × 3 matrix. It is shown, however, that although normalization simplifies the model by removing the random subject effect, it reduces information about the spatial correlation effect, making it harder to detect. This may have implications for other spatial-correlation models that are fitted to residuals from a sample mean. The QD model is applied to 30 cerebral regional glucose metabolism measurements from positron emission tomography (PET) images on a group of 20 normal subjects. {\textcopyright} 1991 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

Accurate p values for local maxima are readily available for isotropic data based on the expected {E}uler characteristic of the excursion set of the test statistic random field. In this article we give a simple method for dealing with nonisotropic data. Our approach has connections to the model of Sampson and Guttorp for nonisotropy in which there exists an unknown mapping of the support of the data to a space in which the random fields are isotropic. Heuristic justification for our approach comes from the Nash embedding theorem. Formally, we show that our method gives consistent unbiased estimators for the true p values based on new results of Taylor and Adler for random fields on manifolds, which replace the Euclidean metric by the variogram. The results are used to detect gender differences in the cortical thickness of the brain and to detect regions of the brain involved in sentence comprehension measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging.},

Thirdly we introduce new local features called the connectivity number (CN) and the connectivity index to study topological properties of a 3D object in a 3D digitized picture. The CN at a 1-voxel (=a voxel with the value 1) x is defined as the change in the {E}uler number of the object caused by changing the value of x into zero, that is, caused by deleting x. Finally, by using them, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition that a 1-voxel is deletable. A 1-voxel x is said to be deletable if deletion of x causes no decrease and no increase in the numbers of connected components, holes and cavities in a given 3D picture.},

abstract = {Methodological research rarely generates a broad interest, yet our work on the validity of cluster inference methods for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) created intense discussion on both the minutia of our approach and its implications for the discipline. In the present work, we take on various critiques of our work and further explore the limitations of our original work. We address issues about the particular event-related designs we used, considering multiple event types and randomisation of events between subjects. We consider the lack of validity found with one-sample permutation (sign flipping) tests, investigating a number of approaches to improve the false positive control of this widely used procedure. We also discuss the implications of our work on the fMRI literature as a whole, estimating that at least 10{\%} of the fMRI studies have used the most problematic cluster inference method (P = 0.01 cluster defining threshold), and how individual studies can be interpreted in light of our findings. These additional results underscore our original conclusions, on the importance of data sharing and thorough evaluation of statistical methods on realistic null data.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging produces data that are continuous in one or more dimensions. This calls for an inference framework that can handle data that approximate functions of space, for example, anatomical images, time-frequency maps and distributed source reconstructions of electromagnetic recordings over time. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is the standard framework for whole-brain inference in neuroimaging: SPM uses random field theory to furnish p-values that are adjusted to control family-wise error or false discovery rates, when making topological inferences over large volumes of space. Random field theory regards data as realizations of a continuous process in one or more dimensions. This contrasts with classical approaches like the Bonferroni correction, which consider images as collections of discrete samples with no continuity properties (i.e., the probabilistic behavior at one point in the image does not depend on other points). Here, we illustrate how random field theory can be applied to data that vary as a function of time, space or frequency. We emphasize how topological inference of this sort is invariant to the geometry of the manifolds on which data are sampled. This is particularly useful in electromagnetic studies that often deal with very smooth data on scalp or cortical meshes. This application illustrates the versatility and simplicity of random field theory and the seminal contributions of Keith J. Worsley (1951-2009), a key architect of topological inference.},

Classical inferences made on the ensuing statistical maps must control family wise error (FWE) when searching across the map's dimensions. In this paper, we borrow multiple comparisons procedures, established in neuroimaging, and apply them to electrophysiological data. These procedures use random field theory (RFT) to adjust p-values from statistics that are functions of time and/or frequency. This RFT adjustment for continuous statistical processes plays the same role as a Bonnferonni adjustment in the context of discrete statistical tests. Here, by analysing the time-frequency decompositions of single channel EEG data we show that RFT adjustments can be used in the analysis of electrophysiological data and illustrate the advantages of this method over existing approaches. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {This is a rambling review of what, with a few notable and significant exceptions, has been a rather dormant area for over a decade. It concentrates on the septuagenarian problem of finding good approximations for the excursion probability {\$}P\backslash{\{}\backslashsup{\_}{\{}t\backslashin T{\}} X{\_}t \backslashgeq \backslashlambda\backslash{\}}{\$} , where $\lambda$ is large, X is a Gaussian, or "Gaussian-like," process over a region T {\$}\backslashsubset \backslashmathscr R{\^{}}N{\$} and, generally, N {\$}{\textgreater}{\$} 1. A quarter of a century ago, there was a flurry of papers out of various schools linking this problem to the geometrical properties of random field sample paths. My own papers made the link via {E}uler characteristics of the excursion sets {\{}t ∈ T: Xt ≥ $\lambda${\}}. A decade ago, Aldous popularized the Poisson clumping heuristic for computing excursion probabilities in a wide variety of scenarios, including the Gaussian. Over the past few years, Keith J. Worsley has been the driving force behind the computation of many new {E}uler characteristic functionals, primarily driven by applications in medical imaging. There has also been a parallel development of techniques in the astrophysical literature. Meanwhile, somewhat closer to home, Hotelling's 1939 "tube formulas" have seen a renaissance as sophisticated statistical hypothesis testing problems led to their reapplication toward computing excursion probabilities, and Sun and others have shown how to apply them in a purely Gaussian setting. The aim of the present paper is to look again at many of these results and tie them together in new ways to obtain a few new results and, hopefully, considerable new insight. The "Punchline of this paper," which relies heavily on a recent result of Piterbarg, is given in Section 6.6: "In computing excursion probabilities for smooth enough Gaussian random fields over reasonable enough regions, the expected {E}uler characteristic of the corresponding excursion sets gives an approximation, for large levels, that is accurate to as many terms as there are in its expansion."

abstract = {The cosmic microwave background (CMB), which permeates the entire Universe, is the radiation left over from just 380,000 years after the Big Bang. On very large scales, the CMB radiation field is smooth and isotropic, but the existence of structure in the Universe - stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, -- suggests that the field should fluctuate on smaller scales. Recent observations, from the Cosmic Microwave Background Explorer to the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, have strikingly confirmed this prediction. CMB fluctuations provide clues to the Universe's structure and composition shortly after the Big Bang that are critical for testing cosmological models. For example, CMB data can be used to determine what portion of the Universe is composed of ordinary matter versus the mysterious dark matter and dark energy. To this end, cosmologists usually summarize the fluctuations by the power spectrum, which gives the variance as a function of angular frequency. The spectrum's shape, and in particular the location and height of its peaks, relates directly to the parameters in the cosmological models. Thus, a critical statistical question is how accurately can these peaks be estimated. We use recently developed techniques to construct a nonparametric confidence set for the unknown CMB spectrum. Our estimated spectrum, based on minimal assumptions, closely matches the model-based estimates used by cosmologists, but we can make a wide range of additional inferences. We apply these techniques to test various models and to extract confidence intervals on cosmological parameters of interest. Our analysis shows that, even without parametric assumptions, the first peak is resolved accurately with current data but that the second and third peaks are not.},

abstract = {In this technical note, we describe and validate a topological false discovery rate (FDR) procedure for statistical parametric mapping. This procedure is designed to deal with signal that is continuous and has, in principle, unbounded spatial support. We therefore infer on topological features of the signal, such as the existence of local maxima or peaks above some threshold. Using results from random field theory, we assign a p-value to each maximum in an SPM and identify an adaptive threshold that controls false discovery rate, using the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) procedure (1995). This provides a natural complement to conventional family wise error (FWE) control on local maxima. We use simulations to contrast these procedures; both in terms of their relative number of discoveries and their spatial accuracy (via the distribution of the Euclidian distance between true and discovered activations). We also assessed two other procedures: cluster-wise and voxel-wise FDR procedures. Our results suggest that (a) FDR control of maxima or peaks is more sensitive than FWE control of peaks with minimal cost in terms of false-positives, (b) voxel-wise FDR is substantially less accurate than topological FWE or FDR control. Finally, we present an illustrative application using an fMRI study of visual attention. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Because of their increased sensitivity to spatially extended signals, cluster-size tests are widely used to detect changes and activations in brain images. However, when images are nonstationary, the cluster-size distribution varies depending on local smoothness. Clusters tend to be large in smooth regions, resulting in increased false positives, while in rough regions, clusters tend to be small, resulting in decreased sensitivity. Worsley et al. proposed a random field theory (RFT) method that adjusts cluster sizes according to local roughness of images [Worsley, K.J., 2002. Nonstationary FWHM and its effect on statistical inference of fMRI data. Presented at the 8th International Conference on Functional Mapping of the Human Brain, June 2-6, 2002, Sendai, Japan. Available on CD-ROM in NeuroImage 16 (2) 779-780; Hum. Brain Mapp. 8 (1999) 98]. In this paper, we implement this method in a permutation test framework, which requires very few assumptions, is known to be exact [J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 16 (1996) 7] and is robust [NeuroImage 20 (2003) 2343]. We compared our method to stationary permutation, stationary RFT, and nonstationary RFT methods. Using simulated data, we found that our permutation test performs well under any setting examined, whereas the nonstationary RFT test performs well only for smooth images under high df. We also found that the stationary RFT test becomes anticonservative under nonstationarity, while both nonstationary RFT and permutation tests remain valid under nonstationarity. On a real PET data set we found that, though the nonstationary tests have reduced sensitivity due to smoothness estimation variability, these tests have better sensitivity for clusters in rough regions compared to stationary cluster-size tests. We include a detailed and consolidated description of Worsley nonstationary RFT cluster-size test. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The asymptotic results that underlie applications of extreme random fields often assume that the variables are located on a regular discrete grid, identified with {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\^{}}2{\$}, and that they satisfy stationarity and isotropy conditions. Here we extend the existing theory, concerning the asymptotic behavior of the maximum and the extremal index, to non-stationary and anisotropic random fields, defined over discrete subsets of {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\^{}}2{\$}. We show that, under a suitable coordinatewise long range dependence condition, the maximum may be regarded as the maximum of an approximately independent sequence of submaxima, although there may be high local dependence leading to clustering of high values. Under restrictions on the local path behavior of high values, criteria are given for the existence and value of the spatial extremal index which plays a key role in determining the cluster sizes and quantifying the strength of dependence between exceedances of high levelsThe general theory is applied to the class of max-stable random fields, for which the extremal index is obtained as a function of well-known tail dependence measures found in the literature, leading to a simple estimation method for this parameter. The results are illustrated with non-stationary Gaussian and 1-dependent random fields. For the latter, a simulation and estimation study is performed.},

abstract = {Many studies of brain function with positron emission tomography (PET) involve the interpretation of a subtracted PET image, usually the difference between two images under baseline and stimulation conditions. The purpose of these studies is to see which areas of the brain are activated by the stimulation condition. In many cognitive studies, the activation is so slight that the experiment must be repeated on several subjects and the subtracted images are averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The averaged image is then standardized to have unit variance and then searched for local maxima. The main problem facing investigators is which of these local maxima are statistically significant. We describe a simple method for determining an approximate p value for the global maximum based on the theory of Gaussian random fields. The p value is proportional to the volume searched divided by the product of the full widths at half-maximum of the image reconstruction process or number of resolution elements. Rather than working with local maxima, our method focuses on the {E}uler characteristic of the set of voxels with a value larger than a given threshold. The {E}uler characteristic depends only on the topology of the regions of high activation, irrespective of their shape. For large threshold values this is approximately the same as the number of isolated regions of activation above the threshold. We can thus not only determine if any activation has taken place, but we can also estimate how many isolated regions of activation are present.},

abstract = {Brain mapping data have been modeled as Gaussian random fields, and local increases in mean are detected by local maxima of a random field of test statistics derived from these data. Accurate p values for local maxima are readily available for isotropic data based on the expected {E}uler characteristic of the excursion set of the test statistic random field. In this article we give a simple method for dealing with nonisotropic data. Our approach has connections to the model of Sampson and Guttorp for nonisotropy in which there exists an unknown mapping of the support of the data to a space in which the random fields are isotropic. Heuristic justification for our approach comes from the Nash embedding theorem. Formally, we show that our method gives consistent unbiased estimators for the true p values based on new results of Taylor and Adler for random fields on manifolds, which replace the Euclidean metric by the variogram. The results are used to detect gender differences in the cortical thickness of the brain and to detect regions of the brain involved in sentence comprehension measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging.},

abstract = {(Abridged) A simple six-parameter LCDM model provides a successful fit to WMAP data, both when the data are analyzed alone and in combination with other cosmological data. Even so, it is appropriate to search for any hints of deviations from the now standard model of cosmology, which includes inflation, dark energy, dark matter, baryons, and neutrinos. The cosmological community has subjected the WMAP data to extensive and varied analyses. While there is widespread agreement as to the overall success of the six-parameter LCDM model, various "anomalies" have been reported relative to that model. In this paper we examine potential anomalies and present analyses and assessments of their significance. In most cases we find that claimed anomalies depend on posterior selection of some aspect or subset of the data. Compared with sky simulations based on the best fit model, one can select for low probability features of the WMAP data. Low probability features are expected, but it is not usually straightforward to determine whether any particular low probability feature is the result of the a posteriori selection or of non-standard cosmology. We examine in detail the properties of the power spectrum with respect to the LCDM model. We examine several potential or previously claimed anomalies in the sky maps and power spectra, including cold spots, low quadrupole power, quadropole-octupole alignment, hemispherical or dipole power asymmetry, and quadrupole power asymmetry. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence for deviations from the LCDM model, which is generally an acceptable statistical fit to WMAP and other cosmological data.},

abstract = {The identification of connexel-wise associations, which involves examining functional connectivities between pairwise voxels across the whole brain, is both statistically and computationally challenging. Although such a connexel-wise methodology has recently been adopted by brain-wide association studies (BWAS) to identify connectivity changes in several mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism and depression, the multiple correction and power analysis methods designed specifically for connexel-wise analysis are still lacking. Therefore, we herein report the development of a rigorous statistical framework for connexel-wise significance testing based on the Gaussian random field theory. It includes controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER) of multiple hypothesis testings using topological inference methods, and calculating power and sample size for a connexel-wise study. Our theoretical framework can control the false-positive rate accurately, as validated empirically using two resting-state fMRI datasets. Compared with Bonferroni correction and false discovery rate (FDR), it can reduce false-positive rate and increase statistical power by appropriately utilizing the spatial information of fMRI data. Importantly, our method bypasses the need of non-parametric permutation to correct for multiple comparison, thus, it can efficiently tackle large datasets with high resolution fMRI images. The utility of our method is shown in a case-control study. Our approach can identify altered functional connectivities in a major depression disorder dataset, whereas existing methods fail.

Specifically we introduce a proper and unbiased estimator for the error terms and provide a more generally correct expression for the effective degrees of freedom. The previous estimates of error variance were biased and, in some instances, could have led to a 10-20{\%} overestimate of Z values.

The Boltzmann/Einstein equations required to predict the CMB temperature/polarization pattern due to primordial gravitational waves are derived. We show that gravitational waves produce a curl component of the CMB polarization while density perturbations (at linear order) do not. We then show how cosmic shear induces a curl component from a curl-free surface of last scattering. We describe, though in less detail, how higher-order correlations can be used to subtract the cosmic-shear--induced curl. Several exercises are provided.},

abstract = {In 1986, R. J. Simes proposed a modified Bonferroni test procedure for testing an overall null hypothesis in multiple testing problems, nowadays referred to as the Simes test. The paper of Simes may be considered as a basic step in the development of many new test procedures and new error rate criteria as for example control of the false discovery rate. A key issue is the validity of the Simes test and the underlying Simes inequality under dependence. Although it has been proved that the Simes inequality is valid under suitable assumptions on dependence structures, important cases are not covered yet. In this note we investigate p-values based on exchangeable test statistics in order to explore reasons for the validity or failure of the Simes inequality. We provide sufficient conditions for the asymptotic validity of the Simes inequality and its possible strictness. We also show by means of an easy-to-compute counterexample that exchangeability by itself is not sufficient for the validity of the Simes inequality.},

abstract = {In this paper we consider probabilistic analogues of some classical integral geometric formulae: Weyl–Steiner tube formulae and the Chern–Federer kinematic fundamental formula. The probabilistic building blocks are smooth, real-valued random fields built up from i.i.d. copies of centered, unit-variance smooth Gaussian fields on a manifold M. Specifically, we consider random fields of the form fp=F(y1(p),{\ldots},yk(p)) for F∈C2(ℝk;ℝ) and (y1,{\ldots},yk) a vector of C2 i.i.d. centered, unit-variance Gaussian fields. The analogue of the Weyl–Steiner formula for such Gaussian-related fields involves a power series expansion for the Gaussian, rather than Lebesgue, volume of tubes: that is, power series expansions related to the marginal distribution of the field f. The formal expansions of the Gaussian volume of a tube are of independent geometric interest. As in the classical Weyl–Steiner formulae, the coefficients in these expansions show up in a kinematic formula for the expected {E}uler characteristic, $\chi$, of the excursion sets M∩f−1[u,+∞)=M∩y−1(F−1[u,+∞)) of the field f. The motivation for studying the expected {E}uler characteristic comes from the well-known approximation .},

abstract = {Our problem is to find a good approximation to the P-value of the maximum of a random field of test statistics for a cone alternative at each point in a sample of Gaussian random fields. These test statistics have been proposed in the neuroscience literature for the analysis of fMRI data allowing for unknown delay in the hemodynamic response. However the null distribution of the maximum of this 3D random field of test statistics, and hence the threshold used to detect brain activation, was unsolved. To find a solution, we approximate the P-value by the expected {E}uler characteristic (EC) of the excursion set of the test statistic random field. Our main result is the required EC density, derived using the Gaussian Kinematic Formula.},

@article{Gration2018,
abstract = {We present a novel and efficient method for fitting dynamical models of stellar kinematic data in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph). Our approach is based on Gaussian-process emulation (GPE), which is a sophisticated form of curve fitting that requires fewer training data than alternative methods. We use a set of validation tests and diagnostic criteria to assess the performance of the emulation procedure. We have implemented an algorithm in which both the GPE procedure and its validation are fully automated. Applying this method to synthetic data, with fewer than 100 model evaluations we are able to recover a robust confidence region for the three-dimensional parameter vector of a toy model of the phase-space distribution function of a dSph. Although the dynamical model presented in this paper is low-dimensional and static, we emphasize that the algorithm is applicable to any scheme that involves the evaluation of computationally expensive models. It therefore has the potential to render tractable previously intractable problems, for example, the modelling of individual dSphs using high-dimensional, time-dependent N-body simulations.},

@article{Siegmund1995,
abstract = {We suppose that our observations can be decomposed into a fixed signal plus random noise, where the noise is modelled as a particular stationary Gaussian random field in N-dimensional Euclidean space. The signal has the form of a known function centered at an unknown location and multiplied by an unknown amplitude, and we are primarily interested in a test to detect such a signal. There are many examples where the signal scale or width is assumed known, and the test is based on maximising a Gaussian random field over all locations in a subset of N-dimensional Euclidean space. The novel feature of this work is that the width of the signal is also unknown and the test is based on maximising a Gaussian random field in N + 1 dimensions, N dimensions for the location plus one dimension for the width. Two convergent approaches are used to approximate the null distribution: one based on the method of Knowles and Siegmund, which uses a version of Weyl's tube formula for manifolds with boundaries, and the other based on some recent work by Worsley, which uses the Hadwiger characteristic of excursion sets as introduced by Adler. Finally we compare the power of our method with one based on a fixed but perhaps incorrect signal width.},

abstract = {Brain mapping data have been modeled as Gaussian random fields, and local increases in mean are detected by local maxima of a random field of test statistics derived from these data. Accurate p values for local maxima are readily available for isotropic data based on the expected {E}uler characteristic of the excursion set of the test statistic random field. In this article we give a simple method for dealing with nonisotropic data. Our approach has connections to the model of Sampson and Guttorp for nonisotropy in which there exists an unknown mapping of the support of the data to a space in which the random fields are isotropic. Heuristic justification for our approach comes from the Nash embedding theorem. Formally, we show that our method gives consistent unbiased estimators for the true p values based on new results of Taylor and Adler for random fields on manifolds, which replace the Euclidean metric by the variogram. The results are used to detect gender differences in the cortical thickness of the brain and to detect regions of the brain involved in sentence comprehension measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging.},
